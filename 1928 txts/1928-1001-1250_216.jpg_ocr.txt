The serous surface is smooth and glistening%;B at the fundus it is dark
red. In the region of the neck it is pink-grey. The wall of the bladder
is somewhat thickened.
The concretion whose shape fits the cavity of the gall
bladder is green-brown, soft and sticky. It is 6.5 cm. long, 2.5 cm. in
diameter and roughly sausage shaped. It resembles a fecolith very much.
In the larger end of the concretion there is a small half-moon shaped area not
covered by soft material; thisarea is smooth, black and hard.
MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION:
In sections of the gall bladder,
the mucous layer is irregular and missing in some areas and where present
is thin. The fibro-muscular layer consists largely of muscle tissue. There
is a slight round cell infiltration of the muscle tissue and the capil-
laries are engorged. Adipose tissue is present. The serosa is slightly
thickened.
