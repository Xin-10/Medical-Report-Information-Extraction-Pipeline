Gross Description: The specimen consists of a small piece of soft tissue
slightly larger than an ordinary grain of wheat. It is firm and elastic
in consistency, pinkish in color. It is partially covered by a piece
of skin. It cuts easily and the cut surface is whitish in color and
fibrosed.
Microscopic: The section shows a mass of rather dense connective
tissue which is lined by stratified epithelium. The lining epithel-
ium shows an intact basement membrane and normal papillary projections.
The corium is rather fibrous and less cellular than normal. The
fibrous connective tissue is hyalinized in some places, and scattered
here and there in the corium are large epithelial like cells which are
in linear formation of from 6 to 8 cells. The cytoplasm of these
The
cells is scanty in amount, finely granular and pinkish in color.
nucleus is markedly hyperchromatic. No mitotic figures, however, can
be seen. Atached to the corium is a small piece of normal adipose
tissue. The blood vessels are normal in appearance. They show no
leucocytic infiltration. It is hard, however, to tell the probable
origin of these l√¶ge, irregular, epithelial like cells.
