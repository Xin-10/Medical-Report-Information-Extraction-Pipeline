Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing OPERATION
Gross Description: The specimens are of gall bladder, and appendix with
attached meso-appendix.
The gall bladder is pear shaped, and measures 9.7 x 4.5 cm. in its
largest dimensions. The surface is glistening, smooth, pinkish and
hemorrhagic. The other surface is roughened, pinkish and hemorrhagic.
The latter surface was detached from the liver. The wall of the gall
bladder is firm and thickened. At the proximal end of the gall bladder
a hard stone, about the size of a hazel nut, is felt. It contains 20 cc.
of slightly thick sero-sanguinous fluid. On one section the gall bladder
cuts very easily after it has been fixed in Formalin for 24 hours. The
wall measures .7 cm. in thickness, the mucosa .15 cm. The lining is
markedly bile stained. At about the fundus there is a stone found. This
stone measures 1.6 cm. in its greatest diameter. It is mostly pigment
cholesterol calcium stone. The stone has formed a shallow fascet on the
walls of the gall bladder about the fundus.
