Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Excision of Nasal Polypi.
Gross Description The specimen is of 10 pieces of nasal polypi. They are shiny, pink-
ish, slightly firm and elastic.
Microscopic: The section shows a stroma of rather loose necrotic, pink staining, gran-
ular tissue, lined by stratified epithelium. The corium immediately underlying the
epithelial layer is full of polymorphs., plasma cells and occasional lymphocytes. A
few mucous glands are seen, with mucoid content. In some of these from 20 to 40 poly-
morphs. are seen. The ducts are lined by high columnar cells on an intact basement
membrane. Many of them show mucoid substance in their lumen, with polymorphs. The
blood vessels are dilated and are filled with red blood cells, polymorphs. and lympho-
cutes. There is definite infiltration of polymorphs. and plasma cells.
