Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Cholecystectomy
Gross description: The formalin injected gall bladder is 8.5 x 3.3 cm.
The cystic duct curves back upon itself for about 1.5 cm. after leaving
the proximal end of the gall bladder and then emerges free from the
serosa. The serosa is smooth and shining.
The
The wall of the open gall bladder, after Formalin fixation, measures .8 mm.,
mucosa is bile stained and the rugae appear normal. The valves are patent to the
water test. There are no concretions.
Microscopic: Section a is from the block taken transversally through
the gall bladder.
Section b is from the block taken longitudinally through the gall
bladder. Neither section shows any pathology, excepting that Aschoff
spaces are present in section b. One of these spaces extends into the
deep areas of the fibro muscularis.
Note: If the presence of Aschoff spaces denotes a chronically distended
gall bladder, the diagnosis would be chronic cholecystitis.
