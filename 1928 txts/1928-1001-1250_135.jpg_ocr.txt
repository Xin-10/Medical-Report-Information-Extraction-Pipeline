Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Section 2 is a section of normal breast tissue with a portion of the
tumor growth. The acini are small; many of them show hyperplasia of
the lining epithelium, with papillary arrangement. In some of the acini
this papillary arrangement of the hyperplastic lining has so encrouched
upon the lumen that it almost obliterates the cavity. The cells are
hyperchromatic and show occasional mitotic figures. The basement membrane
in many places shows extension downward into the supporting stroma of
hyperchromatic cells from the lining epithelium. The connective tissue.
stroma shows slight increase. In some regions there is definite necrosis.
The blood vessels are slightly dilated and filled with occasional red
blood cells and occasional polymorphs. The ducts appear normal, excepting
for a slight dilatation.
Section 3 is a section of the fatty tissue immediately surrounding the
tumor mass. This shows normal fatty tissue.
