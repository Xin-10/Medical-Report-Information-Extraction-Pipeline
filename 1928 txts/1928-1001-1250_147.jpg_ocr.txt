Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Supra-pubic Prostatectomy
Gross DescriptioN: The specimen measures 3 x 2 x 6 cm., and weighs 37
grams. The right lobe, weighing 15 grams, has an intact capsule which is
somewhat hemorrhagic. On palpation several firm nodules are present in the
parenchymatous tissue. The left lobe, weighing 22 grams, median lobe,
weighing 2 grams, and prostatic urethra are in one mass. The urethra is
torn and is impossible to differentiate from the surrounding tissue.
The median and left lobes are nodulated also. On cut section the tissue
bulges outward and many small nodules are noted. Pressure causes some
extravasation of a milky fluid from the edematous surface. Nodules about
1 cm. in diameter may be shelled out from the gland and these cut with
more resistance, although the tissue retains the same general character-
istics above described.

Microscopic: Section 1 is taken from the right lobe. It shows a dense
area of fibrous tissue, with scattered granular structures. The glands
appear normal in size. The lining epithelium consists of one layer of
cells, although in some places it shows definite hyperplasia of the epi-
thelium. from 4 to 8 cells deep. In some of the vesicles small bodies
of concretions are seen. The cells are not hyperchromatic, and do not
show any mitotic figures. The basement membrane is intact. The blood
vessels are normal in appearance. The connective tissue stroma is mark-
edly increased.
Section 2 is from the median lobe. It is essentially similar to secţion
1, except that there is a definite increase in the number of the glands
which show hyperplasia of the lining epithelium in most instances, with
less increase in the connective tissue stroma. The blood vessels are
normal in appearance. Many of the glands show concretions of corpora
amylaca.
