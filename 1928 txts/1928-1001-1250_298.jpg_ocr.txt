Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Cholecystectomy
Gross Description: The Formalin-foxed gall bladder removed measures
7 x 3.5 cm. It contains 40 cc. of thin, clear, straw-colored fluid.
It is pinkish-grey in color and the blood vessels are somewhat congested
with blood. On palpation many stones are noted in the gall bladder.
They range in size from 1 cm. in diameter to .3 cm. The cross section
of the cystic duct presents a thickened mucosa. The lumen is patent.
Microscopic: This is a section of a gall bladder. The lining epithelium has lost
entirely its reticulating fold structure. It is almost flat. The sub-epithelial
layer is slightly thickened. The blood vessels are slightly dilated and contain from
2 to 6 polymorphs. There are occasional plasma cells in this region. The muscularis
is thinner than normal. There is one very much dilated Rokitansky-Aschoff sinus.
The serosa is normal in thickness, and the blood vessels normal in appearance, contain-
ing red blood cells and from 4 to 6 polymorphs. There is slight leucocytic infiltra-
tion.
