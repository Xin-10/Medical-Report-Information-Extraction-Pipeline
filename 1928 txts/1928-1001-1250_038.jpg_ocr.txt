to a large extent by a tumor mass which is slightly yellow
in color and shows areas which appear to be degeneration
the tumor. The pelvis of the kidney is largely obliterated by
the tumor.

in which there is considerable degeneration as evidenced
by fibrosis ad hyalinizaton of glomeruli. There is round
cell infiltration in several places. Adjacent to this region
there is a large area made up of large closely packed cells
with a large amount of clear cytoplasm and eccentrically
arranged nuclei.
