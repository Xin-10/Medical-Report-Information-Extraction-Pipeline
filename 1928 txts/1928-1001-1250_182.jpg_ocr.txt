Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION Excision of Carcinoma (glands)
Gross Description: The mass removed measures 3.5 x 3.5 x 2 cm, is most-
ly made up of a mass of enlarged glands. This is a purplish red in color
and is deeply pitted at one surface. At the base of the area is an ex-
tremely hard, cartilaginous gland which is necrotic on cut section, the
contents being yellow and thick in consistency. The largest of the mass
of glands is 1.5 cm. The glands are pink and soft. On cut section the
glands are pearly white and are not necrotic. The glands represent the
right submaxillary lymph glands. The submental mass measures 3.5 x 2.5
x 1.5 cm., and is made up of connective tissue, fat and one gland, 1 x .5
cm. The gland is soft and appears to be normal. One surface of the mass
is pink and glistening and the other is yellowish pink and is studded by
fat nodules.

Microscopic: Section 1 is a section through the maxillary gland. The capsule of the
gland is made up of connective tissue and slightly dilated blood vessels, with occas-
ional areas of normal looking adipose tissue. The gland proper shows an almost com-
plete replacement of the lymphoid structure by masses and columns of highly keratin-
ized epithelial cells. They assume the structure of stratified epithelium, with
pearl formation. The cells are large, and irregular in shape, with very little cyto-
plasm. The nuclei are hyperchromatic, and many of them show mitosis. In the center of
some of these masses of epithelial cells are areas of slight necrosis and mucoid degen-
eration. The sinuses of the gland are dilated and filled with masses of these epithel-
ial cells. In one region is a small area of lymphoid tissue, with lymphoid follicles
present. In between the masses of epithelial cells are areas of connective tissue
with an abundance of young fibroblasts. The blood vessels are dilated, and they show
no leucocytic infiltration.
