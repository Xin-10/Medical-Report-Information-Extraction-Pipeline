Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Removal of Rectal Papilloma
Gross Description: The specimen consists of two masses of soft tissue,
which measure .4 cm. in the longest diameter. They are pinkish in color
and fibrosed.
Microscopic: The section shows a mass of rather loose connective tissue
lined by a highly reticulating folds of the mucous lining. This lining
is absent in some places. The epithelial cells look normal in most in-
stances. The sub-epithelial layer is slightly thickened and edematous.
It contains a large number of plasma cells, macrophages and polymorphs.
There are papillary projections from some of these folds. This shows
The
normal looking epithelial lining on an intact basement membrane.
‚òê sub-epithelial layer is markedly thickened and infiltrated with numerous
polymorphs. and occasional plasma cells. The blood vessels are dilated
and filled with red blood cells and polymorphs. The center of these papill-
ary projections is made up of necrotic connective tissue. Underlying
the mucosa is a mass of loose connective tissue, which is necrotic in
places. It shows dilated blood cells and marked infiltration of poly-
morphs. and plasma cells.
