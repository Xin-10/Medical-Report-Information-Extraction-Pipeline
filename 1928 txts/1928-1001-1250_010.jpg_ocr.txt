Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing.OPERATION Excision of cyst.
Gross description: The specimen consists of four fragments of fatty
fibrous tissue, which enclosed the aspirated cyst. The cystic cavity is
lined with a haemorrhagic granulation tissue. On cutting, the dense white
cyst is found to contain many miliary abscesses.
Microscopic: The microscopic sections of the wall of the pilonidal cyst
show it to be composed of both young and old connective tissue cells, adipose
tissue, large numbers of capillary buds, a pink staining, granular precipitate,
and a diffuse and heavyly infiltration by round cells, histocytes, plasma
cells and polymorphs. There are some areas throughout this granulation
tissue in which there is a necrosis of the tissue, a pink staining, granular
precipitate, extravasated blood and large numbers of polymorphs. There are
In
some areas in which the fat is extravasated by polymorphs and fibrin.
other areas the round cells are in lymphfollicle formation. I see no evidence
of malignancy or of tuberculosis.
