Section 1 shows a dense mass of fibrous tissue, with glands scattered here
and there. It is incompletely lined with stratified epithelium. In several areas def-
inite erosions of the epithelial lining are seen, with collections of cellular debris,
polymorphs., red blood cells and lymphocytes. There is increased connective tissue
supporting stroma, with scattered dilated blood vessels, many of which show from 8 to
15 polymorphs. There is a definite infiltration of polymorphs. and lymphocytes.
Section 2 is the same as section 1.
Section 3 shows an area of connective tissue, with many scattered glands and cellular
elements. There is marked blood extravasation. The blood vessels are slightly dilated
with an infiltration of polymorphs.
Section 4 is similar to section 3.
