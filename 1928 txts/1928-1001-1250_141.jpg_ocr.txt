Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing.
OPERATION
Salpingectomy
Gross Description: The right Fallopian tube is 13 cm. long, 1.5 cm. at the fimbriated
end and .6 cm. at the uterine end. The serosa is only moderately injected with blood,
and is pink and glistening through most of its length. About 2 cm. from the uterine
end a small, hard mass, 1 x .5 cm., is palpated, which seems to occlude the lumen of
the tube. The tube itself is somewhat enlarged. A probe may be readily passed from
the fimbriated end down to within 1 cm. of the above described mass where obstruction
is encountered. On cut section the lumen is filled by a yellowish-green, mucinous
pus. The mucosa is thickened to 1 mm., ulcerated, edematous and covered with flakes of
whitish material. The point at which the probe met the obstruction is seen to be an
occlusion of the lumen by hard, fibrotic tissue. The hard mass, when opened, is seen
to be a well encapsulated abscess, which is filled with the same type of pus as that
first described.
Blocks: 1. From tubal abscess
2. II tube proper
Microscopic: Section 1 is from a tube where the abscess was found. This shows the
normal articulating folds of the Fallopian tube. The lining epithelium of these folds
is intact, although in some places they are missing, and in this place cellular debris-
collections of polymorphs. and plasma cells are found. The sub-epitheliallayer is
markedly thickened, and covered with collections of polymorphs, red blood cells, oc-
casional plasma cells and lymphocytes. The blood vessels are dilated; many of them
are filled with red blood cells, polymorphs. and lymphocytes. The section shows many
scattered collections of polymorphs., cellular debris, red blood cells, plasma cells
and lymphocytes. The muscularis is not thickened. It shows many dilated blood vessels
with marked cellular infiltration of polymorphs. and occasional plasma cells.
