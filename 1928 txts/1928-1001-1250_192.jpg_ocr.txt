small stones may be distinguished as well as several slightly larger
concretions. Ater fixing for 24 hours, the gall bladder was cut open.
It cuts easily, and about 40 small calcium-pigment stones were found
filling it. The wall of the gall bladder measures 0.6 cm;

These are reduced into an almost flat lining of the epithelium. The sub-epithelial
layer is slightly thickened. The blood vessels are dilated and filled with red blood
cells and from 4 to 6 polymorphs. There is definite infiltration of plasma cells and
occasional eosinphiles. The muscularis is slightly thinner than normal.
