ABSTRACT OF HISTORY OF ELIAS SHUTAN, AGE 65, ADDRESS: 5341 HYDE PARK BLVD.
PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL NO. 207,486.
Diagnosis: Cholecystitis and cholelithiasis.
Death from angina pectoris following operation.
For 35 years patient has had bilious attacks. For seven
years he has had attacks of pain in the epigastrium which were sharp at
times. They were brought on by eating a heavy meal. Enema relieved the fla-
tus and often relieved the attacks. Pain usually reaches its height in 5
minutes. The pains refer to the chest and sometimes out into the arms.
Six weeks ago he had a severe attack from which he collapsed. It lasted
4 hours. He has been confined to bed since then. He sometimes has three
attacks in the week, and again none for a month. He has had attacks of
angina pectoris that have been severe, abdominal pain and gas distension.
Not infrequently comes on after a heavy meal. Physical examination was
negative aside from slight tenderness in the region of the gall bladder.
The heart was slightly enlarged but regular and there were no adventitious
sounds. Blood pressure 116/72. Pulse, temperature, respiration normal.
Diagnosis; Cholelithiasis, but x-rays taken before admission showed
2
sha-
dow of gall stones. The gall bladder was removed 12-30-26. A stone was
found in the cystic duct which was milked out with great difficulty. The
gall bladder was filled with a large stone and also some fluid which had a
green yellow color. Three days later the patient had an anginal attack
from which he died. No autopsy was obtained.
GROSS EXAMINATION: The gall bladder is 11 by 6mcm.
when opened and is roughly triangular. The mucosa lies in folds, and is
very much injected with blood, especially in the region of the fundus.
