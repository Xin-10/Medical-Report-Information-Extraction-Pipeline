Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing.
Section 2 is from the sub-maxillary gland and the salivary gland. The sub-maxillary.
gland appears essentially the same as in section 1. The section through the salivary
gland shows globules which are separated by a thin layer of connective tissue and normal
looking adipose tissue. These globules contain serous glands which have very clear
cytoplasm, are blue and slightly granular, with nucleus excentrically placed. With this
are crescent or albuminous glands, which appear normal. The ducts appear normal. The
blood vessels show slight dilatation if any. No leucocytic infiltration. No evidence
of involvement.
Section 3 is a section through the sub-mental gland. It is made up of lymphoid tissue,
with slight hyperplasia of the lymphfollicles. No mitotic figures seen.
No mitotic figures seen. The sinusoids
are normal in appearance. They contain occasional endothelial cells. The blood vessels
are dilated and filled with red blood cells, occasional polymorphs. and slight infiltra-
tion of of lymphocytes and plasma cells. No evidence of involvement.
