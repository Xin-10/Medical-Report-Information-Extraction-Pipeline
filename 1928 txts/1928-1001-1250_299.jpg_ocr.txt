Biopsy of Right Axillary
Lymph Gland
Gross Description: The specimen is of a hard lymph gland, 1 cm. in
diameter, and covered by yellow fat and fascia. The cut surface is
white and firm.
Microscopic: The section is from the axillary gland. It shows almost complete absence
of the normal lymphoid structure, except in a very small place where lymphfollicles

can still be discerned, with a mass of lymphoid tissue.
of largeirregular cells arranged in papillomatous formation, with a slight stroma of
fibrous connective tissue. The papillary structure is made up of from 8 to 12 cells.
The cells show very little pink, granular cytoplasm, with large, irregular nuclei.
The nuclei are rich in chromatin. They are not hyperchromatic, although they show
mitotic figures in most instances. The stroma is made up of slight connective tissue
with dilated blood vessels filled with red blood cells and occasional polymorphs.
The sinusoids are dilated and many of them are filled with masses of these large,
irregular cells, with mitotic figures in them. In one area there is a region made up
of dense connective tissue with occasional young fibroblasts and slightly dilated
vessels, with very slight areas of lymphoid tissue. The sinuses are dilated in this
region and are filled with masses of large, irregular cells as described above.
