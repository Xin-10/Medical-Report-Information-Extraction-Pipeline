Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing OPERATION
large, round to oval shaped nucleus which is light staining, granular, in a rather
large amount of pink staining, granular cytoplasm. Some of the tumor cells have a tubu-
lar arrangement. Connective tissue separates these tubules and interlaces the tumor
cells. Throughout this area there is an occasional cell with a small, round nucleus, and
cytoplasm filled with pink staining granules. This tissue gradually shades off into
an area which extends through to the serosa, and contains a large amount of connective
tissue, with an occasional tumor cell and a band of smooth muscle.
Section d is taken through the upper fundic portion of the stomach near the cardia, and
appears normal.
Section e is taken through the fundus of the stomach through the thickest portion of
the tumor. The mucosa is replaced by cells arranged in a tubular formation, with a
round, granular, light staining nucleus, and rather a large amount of pink staining,
granular cytoplasm. These tubules are separated by a large amount of connective tissue.
Only an occasional mitotic figure is seen. This tissue gradually shades off into an
area composed of a large amount of connective tissue, with only an occasional tumor
cell, and a round cell infiltration. The muscle bands of the muscularis are greatly
hypertrophied, and separated from one another by dense cellular connective tissue,
with an occasional lymphatic, plugged with tumor cells. The serosa is greatly thickened,
A
infiltrated by connective tissue, containing small islets of 2 to 6 tumor cells.
few of the small veins contain ante-mortem thrombi.
