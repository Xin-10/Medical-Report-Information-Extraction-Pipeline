Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Partial Thyroidectomy
Gross Description: The specimen consists of the anterior portion of both lobes and
isthmus of the thyroid gland, and weighs 28 grams. The capsule is intact anteriorly%;B
smooth, glistening and elevated in various places by small cysts, yellowish and haemorrh-
agic. The cut surface of the gland is covered by a sticky, colloid material, and shows
the gland to be of a diffuse uniform consistency. The right lobe measures 4 x 3 x 1.5
cm., the isthmus 4 x 2 x 1 cm., and the left lobe 4 x 4 x 1.5 cm.
Blocks: 1. Cystic nodule of left lobe
2. From isthmus
Microscopic: Section 1 is from the left lobe of the thyroid. It consists
of vesicles of various sizes. They are dilated in most instances, and
colloid stretched. The lining epithelium is made up of one layer of colum-
nar cells, although in some places there is definite hyperplasia of the
lining epithelium from 3 to 5 cells deep. There is no increase in the
connective tissue stroma. The blood vessels are dilated, and filled with
red blood cells, a few polymorphs. and lymphocytes. There is a definite
collection of round cells in some of the interalveolar spaces. There are
Several small cysts seen.
Section 2 is essentially similar to section 1.
