Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Cholecystectomy and Appendectomy
Gross Description: The vermiform appendix measures 5 x .7 x .7 cm. The serosa is not
injected. The mesoappendix is normal, with normal appearing attached fat. On cut
section the lumen is intact and the mucosa only slightly hyperemic. The wall measures
.4 cm., and the mucosa is .1 cm. thick. The lumen is filled with faecal material.

and
The formalin fixed gall bladder measures 7.5 x 4 x 2.3 cm., weighs 35 grams,
contained 12 cc. of a brownish-green, thick fluid. The sac is not collapsed. In the
central portion of the gall bladder, three hard masses may be palpated in the positions
indicated in the drawing. Several areas of sub-serosal hemorrhage are present. On cut
section the serosa is of normal thickness, while the mucosa is 1.5 mm. in thickness.
The wall in toto is 4 mm. in thickness. At the distal end of the gall bladder invagin-
ation of the wall has produced a second pouch, which is lined by normal smooth mucosa.
This pouch measures 1.5 cm. in diameter. This secondary cavity is in direct continuity
with the first. The major cavity is lined by granular roughened mucosa, which is
flattened to accomodate the stone. One large stone, measuring 3 x 2 x 1 cm., is present.
The weight is 5 grams, and the stone is of the cholesterol-pigment-calcium variety.
It is studded by nodules of apparently calcium concretions. The color is a mixture
of yellow, green, and white.

Microscopic: This is a section from the appendix. The lining epithelium looks normal,
although in places it is missing. The sub-mucosa is normal in thickness, the blood
vessels normal in appearance. There are a few plasma cells, eosinphiles and polymorphs.
in the sub-mucosa. The muscularis is normal in thickness, and so is the serosa.
Section 1 is from the neck of the gall bladder. It shows the normal reticulating
folds of the gall bladder. This is missing, however, in some places. The sub-epithel-
ial layer is slightly thickened.. The blood vessels are slightly dilated and are filled
with red blood cells and from 6 to 12 polymorphs and occasional lymphocytes. The mus-
cularis is normal in thickness. The serosa is normal in thickness. The blood vessels
are dilated and are filled with red blood cells and from 8 to 14 polymorphs. There is a
slight lymphocytic infiltration in some places.
