OPERATION - Dilatation and Currettage of Uterus.
Gross description: This specimen consists of 15 20 fragments of red, granular tissue,
having the appearance of placenta. There are also many incorporated blood clots and fresh
extravasated blood. There is no evidence of a foetus. 2 blocks.
Microscopic: Section a. In microscopic sections of the uterine curretted material, there
are many areas in which the syncitial cells of Hanson make up the majority of the tissue
with extravasated blood. In some areas there are merely one or two syncitial cells in a
stroma composed of Langhans' cells. There is also a large amount of fibrin and extravasated
blood throughout the entire section. At one margin of the section the tissue had lost all
morphological detail, is necrotic, and in some areas along this margin this necrotic tissue
is heavily infiltrated by polymorphs.
Section b is composed of a mass of red blood cells and fibrin.
Section d is composed of strips of light pink staining, homogeneous material, which repre-
sents a cross section of the membrane described above.
Section c is composed of many villi of connective tissue covered by epithelium. The
spaces in between these villi are filled with acellular, pink to light blue staining, gran-
ular protein precipitate. There are also villi here and there which contain giant cellsy
at their margins. The tissue composed of these villi is surrounded by very cellular connec
tive tissue.
