Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing:
GROSS: The specimen consists of a kidney 11 x 6 x 5 cm, with a large mass,
approximately 11 cm in diameter, growing out one side and pole and into a
similar mass 5 x 4 x 3 occupying the hilus region of the kidney and obliterating
the normal structure of the kidney. The specimen is sectioned thru the long
diameter and the hilus margin of the kidney. The cut surface reveals a friable
yellowish tissue which is penetrated by radial trabulae which extend inward
from the capsule. At the base of this mass, near its kidney margin, there is
a hemorrhagic area. The smaller hilus mass is somewhat denser with trabulation
much as in the larger.
MICROSCOPIC: Section 1: Shows a small area of kidney substances which is
markedly compressed and fibrosed; there is considerable lymphocytic infiltration
in this region. A few glomeruli are identified. Beyond this region there is
a dense band of fibrous tissue which separates the tumor from the kidney
parenchyma. The tumor is made up of moderate sized cells with considerable
amount of clear cytoplasm with eccentrically arranged nuclei. A considerable
amount of the tumor appears to be necrotic and the tumor is preserved, expecially
around blood vessels.
Section 2: Shows only tumor made up of the same type of cells described above.
Section 3: Shows practically the same as section 2.
