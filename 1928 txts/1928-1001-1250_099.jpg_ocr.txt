Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Thyroidectomy
Gross description: The specimen is of the anterior portion of both lobes and isthmus of
the thyroid gland, and weighs 51 grams. The capsule is intact and glistening over the
anterior surface. The right lobe is 6 x 5 x 2 cm., and the left 4 x 3 x 1.5 cm., and
the isthmus 1.5 x 2 x 1 cm. At the lower pole of the right lobe is a large nodule 1.5
cm. in diameter, very firm with several small yellow cystic masses on its surface. The
gland cuts easily, but at one point in the right lobe gritty substance was encountered.
At this point is a white calcium deposit about 2 mm. in diameter.
mm. in diameter. A clear yellow fluid
exuded from the center ot the large nddule already described. At the upper pole of this
nodule more of a gritty deposit was encountered. The entire cut surface is of uniform
consistency and has a sticky colloid substance over the surface.
Blocks: 1. Right lobe, through calcified area.
2. Through large nodule.
3. Through left lobe with small cyst.
4. Through left lobe.
5. Through substance of right lobe.
Microscopic:
Section a is composed of acini, which in some areas are very large, lined
by one layer of cuboidal epithelium and filled with colloid. In other areas the acini are
very small but contain colloid.
Section b is similar to section a, excepting that there are very many large acini, some of
which are 1 low power fields in diameter, lined by cuboidal epithelium and filled with
colloid.
Section C.
The majority of section c is composed of large dilated acini, but there are a
few areas in which the acini are of normal size. In one area the acini are very small,
some containing colloid and some containing no colloid. These acini are in a hyalinÄ— ma-
trix.
In this same area there are many papillary folds, some very large, some very small.
The stroma of the folds is hyaline material, covered by cuboidal epithelial cells one
layer deep. In another region of this section some of the large dilated acini contain
extravasated blood.
Section d is the same as section c.
