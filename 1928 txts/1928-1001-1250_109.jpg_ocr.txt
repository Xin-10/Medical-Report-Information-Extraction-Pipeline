Thyroid Lobectomy
Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Gross Description: The anterior portion of the right lobe of the thyroid
weighs 137 grams and measures 8.5 x 7 x 4.5 cm. It is well encapsulated
by glistening hemorrhagic capsule, excepting at the superior posterior
pole, where the capsule is gone over anarea 1 x 1 cm. The tissue seen
through the transparent capsule is pigmented bluish black in somel areas
and yellowish pink in others. Many small sub-capsular colloid or cystic
areas are present. The capsule is irregularly trabeculated by thin strands
of connective tissue. On cut section the gland is mottled red-brown, pink,
yellow and grayish-green. There are many cysts from 0.1 to 5 cm. in
diameter, from which colloid may be expressed. Other cysts are filled with
a thin reddish-brown fluid. Small star-shaped areas of white fibrous tissue
are present here and there on the surface. There are no definite nodules
and there is an abundance of colloid throughout the entire gland.
Blocks: 1. Thyroid tissue through capsule.

in mid-section.
Microscopic: This is a section from the thyroid gland consisting of varying sizes of
vesicles, many of which are filled with evaculated colloid. There is an increase in the
connective tissue stroma. The blood vessels are slightly dilated. There are no collec-
tions of lymphoid cells. Some of the vesicles show slight hyperplasia of the lining epithel-
Iron pigment is seen in some places.
