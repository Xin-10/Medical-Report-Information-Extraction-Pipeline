Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Excision of Papilloma.
Gross description: The tissue consists of an eliptical fragment of skin
.6 cm. long, with a small, firmly attached papillary tumor mass. At its
widest portion it measures .3 cm.
Microscopic: This is a section of skin with intact stratified epithelial lining. The
lining shows an intact basement membrane and normal looking papillary projections. Some
of the projections show slight mucinous degeneration in their center. No hyperchromatism
or mitotic figures are seen. The glands appear normal. The corium is fibrotic and
with sparse cellular elements.
There is no sign of malignancy.
