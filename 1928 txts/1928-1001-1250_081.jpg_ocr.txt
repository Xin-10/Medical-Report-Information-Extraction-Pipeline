GROSS DESCRIPTION: The gross specimen is made up of a spherical mass of
tissue 3 cm. in diameter bearing two protruding masses of fat about 1 cm.
each in diameter. The tissue is from the wall of the stomach. There is a
defect on the mucosal side of the tissue 5 mm. in diameter, which has eroded
the mucosa to extend 5 mm. into the underlying tissues. The floor of the
ulcer is rough and contains bridges of tissue caused by the erosion of
other tissue beneath. The wall of the stomach is thick and firm as shown
in a cut section of the gross specimen.
