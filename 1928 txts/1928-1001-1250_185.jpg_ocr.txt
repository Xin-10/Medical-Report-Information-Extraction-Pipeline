gland shows normal lymphoid structure, except that there is probably
slight hyperplasia of the lymphfollicles. No mitotic figures are seen.
The capsuler blood vessels are engorged with red blood cells, some show-
ing a few polymorphs. and lymphocytes. The sinusoids - marginal and at
about the hilus of the gland - show marked hyperplasia of the endothel-
ium. The hyperplasia is so much that in most instances the cells fill
the wholedsinus. The nuclei are slightly hyperchromatic, but no mitotic
figures are seen. Some of these cells, however, look like epithelial
cells with slight amount of cytoplasm which stains pink and is slightly
granular. The nucleus is large, irregular in shape and slightly hyper-
chromatic. No mitotic figures are seen.
