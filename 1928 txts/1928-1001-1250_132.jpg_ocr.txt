Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Polya operation.
Gross Description: The specimen is that of the pyloric 2/3 of the stomach,
with attached omentum and weighs 202 grams. The serosa is glistening and
pinkish. The mucosa is pinkish, glistening, with few haemorrhagic spots
on the lesser curvature. There are two small ulcers about 0.2 cm. in di-
ameter. The rugae are normal. There can be palpated along the greater
curvature on the posterior wall, 12 cm. from the pyloric sphincter, a hard
indurated mass about the size of a quarter. On the inner surface at
this point there is an ulcerated oval-shaped area in the mucosa, 1 cm. in
diameter. Around this the rugae are edematous and bulge from the mucosa
in a greater degree than the normal rugae. The margin is shallow, sharp-
ly outlined and quite hard. The floor is irregular in appearance, with
small haemorrhagic projections. The serosa underlying the ulcer looks
normal, and it appears slightly injected. The attached omentum (4-7cm.)
is of normal fat and connective tissue. There is an enlarged palpable
lymph node present. about the region of the ulcer; and many small ones
along the greater curvature. These glands are quite soft. The enlarged
gland cuts easily, without resistance. The cut surface bulges out, and
a thin, whitish fluid could be expressed from it.
Blocks: 1. Enlarged gland.
2. Wall of the lesion.
3. Normal wall of stomach near pyloric end.
4. Section through small ulcer, 3 cm. from lesion.
Microscopic: Section 1 is a section of the enlarged gland. It shows a mass of lymphoid
tissue with slight fibrous tissue stroma and areas of normal looking adipose tissue.
There is hyperplasia of the follicles. No karyokinetic figures are seen. The sinuses
are normal in appearance and contain masses of endothelial cells. The blood vessels are
slightly dilated and filled with red blood cells, occasional polymorphs., lymphocytes
and endothelial cells. No evidence of malignancy.
