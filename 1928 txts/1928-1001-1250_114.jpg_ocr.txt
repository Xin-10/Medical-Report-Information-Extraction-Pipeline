Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Thyroidectomy.
Gross decription: The specimen is of two thyroid cysts and 1 piece of
normal thyroid 1 x 1 x 0.4 cm. The larger cyst is 3 cm. in diameter.
The external surface is hemorrhagic and roughened. The cyst wall is pink-
ish, firm and about 0.3 cm. thick. The interior is filled with a light
brown, Soft material resembling a degenerating blood clot. On the inner
surface is a dendrite yellow, firm fibrous material, and between the
branches the pinkish cyst wall shines through. The smaller cyst is 1 cm.
in diameter. This resembles the description of the larger cyst, excepting
that it contains no blood. The small piece of tissue from the normal
part of the gland is pink, firm, diffuse, and sticky because of the
colloid material in the tissue.
Blocks: 1. Thru large cyst with degenerating blood clot.
2. Entire small cyst.
3. Normal thyroid tissue.
Microscopic:
Section 1 is a section from the thyroid with marked increase of the supporting
stroma of connective tissue. The vesicles as a whole contain colloid. Some are dilated,
others are normal in appearance, while still others are displaced by connective tissue.
The lining epithelium of the vesicles is intact and is made up of one layer of low
columnar cells. In one region there is a large circumscribed area of connettive tissue,
which is slightly necrotic and practically acellular. The blood vessels are normal in
appearance. Here and there is an extravasation of red blood cells. Some of these
are in a collection within several dilated vesicles. In some places the haemorrhage is
so marked that it has replaced the vesicles in the connective tissue stroma.
Section 2 is nothing but a huge collection of organizing blood clots, with scattered
iron pigments.
Section 3 is essentially the same as section 1, exvepting that there are more dilated
blood vessels and haemorrhagic areas and blood filled vesicles. Many of the vesicles
are dilated with colloid which is evaculated.
