Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Excision of Sebaceous Cyst &
Fibromata Molluscum.
Gross Description: The specimen is a formalin fixed white, friable cyst,
1.3 cm. in diameter, and four small, white, friable masses, about 1 mm.
in diameter. They are quite soft, lined by whitish and friable mucosa
and covered by a thin, glistening capsule of fibrous tissue.
Microscopic: The section shows the lining of the cyst. It is made up
of stratified epithelium on an intact basement membrane. There is one
normal looking papillary projection. Overlying this epithelial lining
is a layer of hyalinized tissue. A portion of the corium is seen. It
is made up of rather loose connective tissue with slightly dilated blood
vessels. No leucocytic infiltration.
