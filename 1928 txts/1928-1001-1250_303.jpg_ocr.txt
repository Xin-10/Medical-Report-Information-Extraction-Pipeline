Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing.
OPERATION Mastectomy, Right
Gross Description: The specimen consists of the right breast. It weighs 655 grams.
At about
It consists of the normal fatty tissue and the underlying pectoralis muscles.
the upper right quadrant there is definite retraction of the skin. Upon palpation of
this region there was felt a markedly indurated mass which is adherent to the skin.
The mass is not movable. About the left upper quadrant, just 2 cm. from the nipple,
is a small indurated mass, which feels as if it were deep in location, is adherent,
slightly indurated and not movable. Upon cutting into the adherent mass which pro-
duces the retraction in the right upper quadrant, there is a markedly indurated region
which measures 2 cm. in its longest diameter. It cuts with difficulty, and grits on
cutting. The surface is hard and is retracted, and covered by white fibrous tissue.
The margin is slightly raised. The section immediately surrounding this is largely
firm and fibrosed. There are several enlarged pectoral glands felt. The glands are
firm, elastic, and cut easily. The cut surface bulges out and is greyish in color.
Microscopic: Section 1 is a section through the lesion. It shows a mass of fibrous
tissue that is hyalinized in many places. The normal appearance of the acini is
entirely absent. The acini that are present contain masses of large, irregular cells,
the use of which is very scanty, granular and pinkish in color. The nuclei of the
cells are large and hyperchromatic, with "Figures seen. In some places the cells are ar-

by hyalinized connective tissue, with small scattered masses of large, irregular cells
