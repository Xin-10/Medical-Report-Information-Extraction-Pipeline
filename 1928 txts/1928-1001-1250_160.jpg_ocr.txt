Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION Appendectomy
Gross Description: The specimen is that of an appendix. It measures
5 x .6 cm. It is slightly firm. Its peritoneal surface is pinkish.
About the middle of the appendix, about its meso-appendix, is a large
hemorrhagic area, which apparently is sub-serous. The blood vessels are
slightly injected. It cuts easily. The mucosa is edematous, and shows
many scattered small hemorrhagic spots. The wall measures .4 cm., the
mucosa, .2 cm. There is no concretion.
Microscopic: This is a section from the appendix. The lining epithelium is normal in
appearance. In the sub-mucosa there are two dilated blood vessels, which are filled
with red blood cells and from 10 to 14 polymorphs. Very occasional plasma cells are
seen. The muscularis is normal in thickness. The serosa is normal.
