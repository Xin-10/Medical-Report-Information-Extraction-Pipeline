Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing OPERATION
Radical Amputation of the breast.
Gross Description: The breast and an eliptical section of skin
measures 20 x 10 cm. Extending laterally, a triangular shaped area, with
the apex at the nipple and the base somewhat superior is a hard nodular
mass which is firmly adherent to the surounding tissue. The mass
measures approximately 5 cm. at the base with sides measuring about 7 cm.,
and about 3 cm. deep. At the lateral, superior border of the specimen
is another mass composed of hard enlarged lymph glands about 2 x 2 cm.
The nipple is not retracted. On cut section the breast mass is seen to
be composed of a firm pinkish white, glistening tissue which is flecked
with innumerable small yellow granules. Extending from the mass through
the breast fat are streaks of dense white tissue. The mass of glands
at the lateral superior border on cut section are seen to have a hard
cartilaginous capsule and the lymphoid tissue is completely obliterated
by caseous, necrotic material. The other lymph glands removed possess
normal appearing capsules, but they are anthracotic, and filled with a
caseous material. These latter glands were removed from around the
axillary vein.ns as it
