Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION Inversion of hydrocoele sac and
excision of varicose veins, and
internal urethrotomy.
Gross description: The specimen consists of 13 fragments of tortuous,
firm veins measuring from 14 cm. in length to 1 cm. There is also a small
fragment of fat tissue measuring 2 x 2 cm. The vein walls are thickened
and do not collapse on sectioning.
Microscopic: The microscopic sections of the veins show them to be very
thick-walled, containing more connective tissue and muscle than is normal.
However, the predominance of overgrowth is that of the connective tissue.
The lumen of the vein is filled with a pink staining, granular precipitate
and red blood cells, with a sharp line of demarkation between the red
blood cells and the pink staining, granular precipitate.
