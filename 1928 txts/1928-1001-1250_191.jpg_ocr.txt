Gross Description: The specimen is of two fistulous tracts with skin
at one end, and rectal mucosa at the other. Surrounding the tracts is
yellow fat and firm dense white connective tissue. The longest measures
2.5 cm.
Microscopic: This is a mass of rather dense connective tissue, with areas
of normal adipose tissue. There are several scattered collections of
round cells and lymphoid tissue. There is slight haemorrhage. The blood
vessels are markedly dilated with definite infiltration of plasma cells,
occasional polymorphs. and lymphocytes. The connective tissue stroma
shows slight necrosis in places.
