Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Microscopic: Section 1 is from the body of the gall bladder. It shows the
folds of the lining epithelium in a very small place. It is practically
absent in the other places. The sub-epithelial layer is markedly thickened
with hemorrhage. There is definite infiltration of polymorphs, a few
lymphocytes and plasma cells. Some of these dilated vessels contain 16
polymorphs. The muscularis is nearly gone, apparently replaced by young
connective tissue with fibroblasts. This slows slight mucoid degeneration
in some places. The blood vessels are markedly engorged.. There is slight
hemorrhage in this layer. The peri-muscular layer is normal in thickness.
So is the serosa. The blood vessels are markedly dilated, with infiltra-
tion of polymorphs. and plasma cells.
Section 2 is from the neck of the gall bladder. The lining epithelium
is completely gone. The muscularis is normal in thickness. There are two
Rokitansky Aschoff sinuses seen. It is slightly edematous. The blood
vessels are markedly engorged. There is marked hemorrhage in this layer.
Occasional plasma cells and polymorphs. ane seen scattered in this layer.
The serosa is normal in thickness. There is definite perivascular infil-
tration.
The section from the appendix shows slight dilatation of the blood
vessels in the sub-epithelial layer and the sub-mucosa, with slight in-
filtration of plasma cells and occasional polymorphs. The muscular layer
and the serosa are normal in thickness. They appear normal except for
the slight infiltration of lymphocytes around the blood vessels.
