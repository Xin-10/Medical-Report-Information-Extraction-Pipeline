Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION Fulgeration. Excision - Suprapubic
Cystotomy.
Gross Description: The specimen consists of 5 small pieces of tissue from the bladder
wall. The tissue is hemorrhagic, white, friable and firm. There are no papiform
extensions from the mucosa. The largest piece measures 1 x .5 x .5 cm.
Microscopic: The section shows masses and collections of large, irregular and epitheli-
al like cells. In many places these show suggestive papillary formation. The cells
are large, irregular in shape, slightly hyperchromatic. There are mitotic figures
seen in many of the cells. In between these masses of epithelial cells and in the
centre of many of them are areas of hemorrhage. The blood vessels are dilated and they
contain red blood cells and occasional polymorphs. There is a slight lymphocytic infil-
tration and occasional plasma cells and polymorphs. Collections of polymorphs. and plas-
ma cells with red blood cells are seen in places. The connective tissue supporting
stroma does not show any appreciable increase. The blood vessels in them are immensely
dilated.
Sections 2 and 3 are similar to section 1.
