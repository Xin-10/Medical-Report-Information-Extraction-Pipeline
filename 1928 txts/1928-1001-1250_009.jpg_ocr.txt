Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Excision of anal polypi and
repair of anal fistula.
Gross description: The specimen is of three fragments of anal polypi.
These are pink, firm and covered by a white, glistening mucosa.
Microscopic: In microscopic sections of the tissue removed from the anus,
the epithelium appears normal. The underlying connective tissue is very
loose and its fibers are separated by a pink staining, granular precipitate.
There is one area near the center of the section in which there is granula-
tion tissue composed of old connective tissue cells heavily infiltrated by
round cells. Several of the blood vessels throughout the tissue contain
polymorphs, and there are some areas in which there is a perivascular in-
filtration.
