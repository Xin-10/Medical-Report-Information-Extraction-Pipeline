Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing OPERATION
Biopsy of Cervical Erosion.
Gross description: The specimen consists of two fragments of mucous mem-
brane and extravasated blood. The fragments are Formalin fixed.
Microscopic: Section a is a section of the cervix, covered by stratified
squamous epithelium. In several areas the outermost layer and cornified
layer of the epithelium contain large cysts filled with a pink staining,
granular precipitate and red blood cells. This stratified squamous epi-
thelium gradually shades over to columnar epithelium in the deeper por-
tions of the section. In some areas this columnar epithelium is denuded,
and the connective tissue of the mucosa in these areas is infiltrated by
where
round cells. In other area the mucosa is denuded there is a hyperplasia
of the connective tissue cells of the mucosa. Red blood cells and cellu-
lar debris overlie this area. The mucous glands appear normal, as does
also the muscularis.
L
Section b is a mass of red and white blood cells, with fibrin. There is
also one frgment of cervical tissue, which shows nothing but what has
been described above.
