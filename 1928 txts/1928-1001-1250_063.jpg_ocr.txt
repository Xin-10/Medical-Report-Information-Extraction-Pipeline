Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing:
SUMMARY OF CASE: Age, 35. Noticed swelling in front of larynx for 2-3 years,
which was opened by a physician and this wound had opened and closed re-
peatedly since. Examination showed walnut sized swelling anterior to larynx
with a fistulous opening. Methylene blue injected came out at foramen caecum.
Excision of mass and sinus to foramen caecum with removal of middle of hyoid
bone. Post-operative pneumonia. Recovery.
GROSS:
The specimen consists of a thyro-glossal cyst which is 7 cm in length and
3 cm wide through the most dilated portion. The non-dilated portion of the cyst
is 3 cm long, is grayish-brown in appearance, is firm in consistency and attached
to it is the dilated portion which is practically the same color but is roughened.
The part proximal to the undilated portion contains a spicule of bone.
MICROSCOPIC: The section is thru wall of the cyst and shows a high columnar cell
epithelial lining of the sac, with submucosal inflammation as evidenced by a
moderate lymphocytic infiltration. There is also considerable fibrosis of the
wall.
