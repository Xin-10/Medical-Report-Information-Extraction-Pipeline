Gross Description:
Removal of Growth, Esophagus,
for Biopsy.
The specimen is a small piece of soft tissue about
4 mm. in diameter. It is whitish in color and quite firm in consis-
tency.

This is a mass of broken down tissue with occasional
large cells. These cells show much pinkish, finely granular cytoplasm.
The nucleus is irregular in shape. They stain quite poorly. No
mitotic figures are seen. Scattered in this mass of necrotic tissue
are a fair number of polymorphs. and plasma cells. No signs of mal-
ignancy.
