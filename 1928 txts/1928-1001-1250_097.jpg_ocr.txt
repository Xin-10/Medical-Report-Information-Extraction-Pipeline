Dilatation and
Currettage. Bilateral Partial Oophor-
ectomy.
Gross Description: The specimen consists of three fragments of normal uterine mucosa;
fragments of curretted uterine mucous membrane with blood; and a portion of the
cervix, of the circumference, and 2 x 1 cm. in size. There is an ulcerated area 2 x 2 mm.
on the cervical mucosa. There is also the anterior portion of both ovaries, one with
several small simple cysts containing clear amber fluid, and the other with a corpus
luteum.
Blocks: 1. Curretted material - 2 blocks
2. Cervix
3. Anterior portion of ovary

Microscopic: Section a is an area of fairly loose connective tissue surrounded by
a slightly necrotic supporting stroma of practically acellular connective tissue.
The cells are arranged in columns. There are large luteal cells. In the center of the
region is an area of extravasated and degenerated red blood cells. The blood vessels
are slightly dilated and show no leucocytic infiltration.
Section b is a section from the cervix. It is incompletely lined with stratified epi-
thelium which is practically separated from the substance of the cervix with a layer of
cellular debris. The cervical glands are slightly dilated. Many of them show polymorphs.
in their lumen. Near the os there is a region filled with a mass of polymorphs., and
some degenerated red blood cells. The sub-epithelial layer is slightly thickened.
The blood vessels are slightly dilated. There is a slight leucocytic infiltration.
Section is from the anterior portion of the ovary. This shows a dense area of connec-
tive tissue with spindle shaped cells. At the center of the area is a rounded,
immensely dilated cavity filled with degenerated red blood cells. Surrounding this cav-
ity the connective tissue shows slight necrosis in places. The blood vessels are slight-
ly dilated. There is no definite leucocytic infiltration.
