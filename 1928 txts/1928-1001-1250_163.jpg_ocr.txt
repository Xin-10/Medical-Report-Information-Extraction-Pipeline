Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION Supra pubic Prostatectomy
Gross Description: The specimen consists of the left and right lobes
of the prostate. They are covered by a pinkish, glistening capsule.
It is firm and elastic. No definite nodules could be palpated. It weighs
20 grams. The left lobe is about 4 times as big as the right, and measures
3 cm. in diameter. It is oval in shape. It cuts with slight resistence.
The cut surface bulges out, and shows many yellowish nodules that readily
stand out. These are separated by slight trabeculae of connective tissue.
There is a thin whitish fluid which comes out of the prostatic parenchy-
ma on pressure. These nodules measure 1 cm. in diameter.
Blocks: 1. from large mass.

11 small
Microscopic: Section 1 is a section from the right lobe of the prostate.
It shows a fair number of gbanular tissue and vessicles. As a whole, they
are lined by one layer of high columnar cells on an intact basement mem-
brane. In some places the lining epithelium shows slight hyperplasia,
containing from 2 to 8 cells. The cells are not hyperchromatic and do
not show any mitosis. The vesicles are of different sizes and shapes.
Most of them contain pink staining, granular material. The connective
tissue stroma is increased in amount. The blood vessels are normal in
appearance. There is no lymphocytic infiltration.
Section 2 is essentially similar to section 1. It shows a well circum-
scribed mass of granular tissue within a narrow strip of dense connec-
tive tissue. The vesicles have different shapes, many of them are dilated.
The lining epithelium is made up of one layer of columnar cells, although
in some places it shows slight hyperplasia. The vesicles contain pink
staining, granular material in most instances. The stroma of connective
tissue shows slight increase.
