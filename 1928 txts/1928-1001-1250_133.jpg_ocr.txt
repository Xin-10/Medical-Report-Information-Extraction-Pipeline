Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing.
Section 2 is through the margin and floor of the lesion. It shows the slightly denuded
mucous lining of the stomach in one area, while at the other portion of the section,
this is completely missing. This apparently is the floor of the lesion. The sub-epithel-
ial layer is thickened. The blood vessels are dilated. There is definite infiltration
of occasional polymorphs. and many plasma cells, with occasional eosinphiles. The glands
look normal. The lining epithelium stains normal. Most of them contain mucinous substance.
The sub-mucosa is slightly edematous. The blood vessels are dilated. Ther is infiltra-
tion of plasma cells, eosinphiles and occasional polymorphs. throughout this layer. The
muscularis is normal in thickness, although it is more fibrosed than normal.
occasional fibroblasts. The blood vessels are slightly dilated and filled with bed blood
cells and occasional polymorphs. There are scattered patches of normal looking adipose
tissue.
There are
The area, which apparently forms the floor of the lesion, shows complete absence
of the gastric epithelialm glands. It is made up of connective tissue, which shows slight
necrosis, slight haemorrhage and marked infiltration of plasma cells, occasional poly-
morphs. and lymphocytes. The blood vessels are dilated and filled with red blood cells
and from 14 to 18 polymorphs. The serosa of the whole section is normal in thickness.
There is definite infiltration of lymphocytes in all the blood vessels.
Section 3 is through the normal wall of the greater curvature of the stomach, about two
inches from the pyloris. The lining epithelium looks normal. The muscularis and the
serosa are normal in thickness. The blood vessels are not dilated. Many of them con-
tain red blood cells and from 8 to 10 polymorphs. and occasional lymphocytes.
