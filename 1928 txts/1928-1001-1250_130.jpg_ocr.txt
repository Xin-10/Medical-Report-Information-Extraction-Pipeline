Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Gross Description: The specimen consists of an eliptical fragment of skin
and tumor - 3.5 x 2.5 cm., of which the tumor area comprises a circular
area 2 cm. in diameter. The tumor surface is elevated and well limited,
and consists of cornu cutaneum, through which long black pilae protrude.
Removal of the friable cornu cutaneum presents an ulcerated area which is
somewhat indurated. The under surface is composed of normal connective
tissue. On cut section, the growth does not penetrate deeper than the dermis.
Blocks: 1. Tumor
OPERAT
2. Cornu cutaneum
Microscopic: Section
Section 1 is a section from the crust of the skin lesion. It is made up
of secretion, with slight fibrous tissue. The cells are nucleated and take the stain
very well.
Section 2 is through the skin lesion. It shows a corium which is slightly more fibrous
than normal. The blood vessels are slightly dilated. There is definite infiltration of
round cells, occasional plasma cells, and a few polymorphs. This is lined by stratified
epithelium, with numerous long papillary projections. There is definite epithelial
hyperplasia in the form of masses of epithelium scattered in the corium. Many of these
masses are connected together in the form of a network. The cells are hyperchromatic
and occasional mitotic figures are seen. Scattered here and there in the papillary
projections and in the masses of epithelium in the corium are irregular dark bodies,
which probably are artifacts.
