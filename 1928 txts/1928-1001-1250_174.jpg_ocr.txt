Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Right Salpingectomy and Oophorectomy
Gross Description: The specimen is of right Fallopian tube and a part of the right
ovary. The tube measures 11 cm. long and has a diameter of .6 cm. The lumen is not
patent throughout. An obstruction is met 4 cm. from the proximal end. The serosa is
brownish and glistening, except at a roughened area 1 cm. from the ovarian attachment.
The muscularis is firm with a hard indurated area at the point of obstruction. The
mucosa is pinkish and appears grossly normal except that the folds are exaggerated.
There is a small piece of ovary 1,3 x 1 x 0.1 cm. attached to the tube near its proxi-
mal end. The serosa of the ovary is glistening, pinkish and has protruding from it
2 small cysts, which exude a clear brownish yellow fluid on being cut. The ovary mea-
sures 2 x 1.6 x 0.5. The parenchyma is firm, pinkish and appears grossly normal ex-
cept for the small cysts just described.
Blocks: 1. Thru ovary (cyst)
2. I indurated portion of tube.
3. From normal parenchyma
Microscopic:
Section 1 is a section through an enlarged cyst and normal parenchyma
of the ovary.
The
In the center of the area is a huge cyst lined by fibrous tissue.
portion of the ovary is lined by low columnar epithelium. Underlying this is a mass
of fibrous tissue stroma with many spindle shaped cells. The blood vessels are dilated
and are filled with red blood cells. In one place, apparently at about its surface
near the broad ligament, is a strip of smooth muscle. This is vascular. The vessels
are dilated and are filled with red blood cells. There is no lymphocytic infiltration.
There is one vessel that is enormously dilated and filled with degenerated red blood
cells.
Section 2 is a section through the indurated portion of the tube. It presents the nor-
mal reticulating folds and the normal epithelium of the bube. The epithelial layer is
slightly thickened. The blood vessels are slightly dilated and contain from 3 to 6
polymorphs. Some show definite lymphocytic infiltration. The stroma is made up of
rather loose connective tissue, which shows slight necrosis in some portions.
vessels in this layer are dilated and show infiltration of lymphocytes and occasional
polymorphs.
