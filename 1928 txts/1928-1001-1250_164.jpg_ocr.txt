Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION Exploratory Laparotomy.
Gross Description: The specimen consists of a cyst with all the content already evaculated.
It shows two lobules. With all the content out, this measures 10 x 7 cm. It is covered
by a thin, pinkish, glistening membrane. It shows a few small hemoragic spots. The cover-
ing membrane seems to be intact throughout, except in one portion where it is denuded,
and covered by course, firm fibrous tissue of the cyst of the size of a dollar. The
lining of the cavity is small, with prominent blood vessels. There is also a small strip
of normal skin with underlying cutaneous tissue.
Microscopic: The section shows an area of rather dense connective tissue. It is imper-
fectly lined by one layer of cuboidal cells, arranged in low folds. In the stroma are
an abundance of spindle shaped cells, especially about the center and immediately under-
lying the lining epithelium. The connective tissue is necrotic in some places. The
blood vessels are normal in appearance. There is no lymphocytic infiltration.
region there is a suggestion of a glandular formation with lining epithelium, which
shows fold formation in some places. The cells do not show any hyperchromatism or
mitosis.
