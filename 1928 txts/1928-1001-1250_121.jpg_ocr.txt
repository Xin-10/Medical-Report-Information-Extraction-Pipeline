Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Dacryocystectomy.
Gross Description: The specimen consists of two fragments of the lacrimal
sac. The larger fragment preserves the form of the sac and consists of
a glistening connective tissue covering with an injected and edematous
lining; it measures about .8 x .8 cm.
Microscopic: The section shows an area of connective tissue incompletely lined by strati-
fied epithelium. The lining epithelium shows an occasional break, with collections of
cellular debris, red blood cells and lymphocytes, and an occasional polymorph. The basement
membrane seems to be intact. The sub mucosa is cellular, with collections of lymphoid
tissue, with dilated blood vessels which show slight lymphocytic infiltration. There are
occasional large cells within the capillaries. No hyperchromatism and no mitosis are seen.
Surrounding this layer is a region of connective tissue, which shows slight necrosis.
The blood vessels are slightly dilated with lymphocytic infiltration, a few plasma cells
and occasional polymorphs.
