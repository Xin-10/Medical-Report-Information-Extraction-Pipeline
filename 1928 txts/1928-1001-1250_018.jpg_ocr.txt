Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Microscopic: Section a is taken from the mesentery of the lesser curvature
of the stomach. It contains normal adipose tissue, with areas of connective
tissue which occupy an entire low power field. These areas of connective
tissue contain lymphatic vessels which are greatly enlarged and fibrosed by
rather young connective tissue. The lumen of some of these vessels contain
a pink staining, granular precipitate. In other areas the pervascular
lymphatics are plugged by tumor thrombi. These tumor cells contain a round
pychotic, granular nucleus, with a rather large amount of pink staining
cytoplasm. No mitotic figures are seen. Several of the small veins contain
ante-mortem thrombi%3 others large numbers of polymorphs.
Section b is a section of a lymph gland at the pyloris on the greater
curvature. Many of the lymphfollicles are hyperplastic. Around the entire
margin of the gland the sinuses are engorged by cells which have a round,
granular, pycnotic nucleus, and a rather large amount of pink staining
cytoplasm. No mitotic figures are seen. Throughout the entire gland
there is an occasional sinusoid that is engorged by these tumor cells.
Some of them extend down from the peripheral sinusoid. Throughout the
capsule of the gland there are many small lympnatics plugged by tumor cells
and islets of 2 to 15 tumor cells throughout the connective tissue.
Section C is a section through the pyloris, and a margin of the tumor.
The mucosa of the pyloris and the pyloric glands is normal. The muscularis
is greatly hypertrophied. The serosa is greatly thickened by connective
tissue which contains an occasional islet of 2 to 6 tumor cells. The mucosa
of the pyloris ends abruptly and a tumor area begins. The mucosa of the
tumor area contains only an occasional crypt. The majority of it is smooth,+
covered by epithelium of cuboidal type, one cell deep. This epithelium is
the same type of epithelium as is seen in the crypts where present. Just
beneath this epithelium is an occasional remnant of the gastric crypts
and a large amount of connective tissue. The fundic glands of the submucosa
are infiltrated by connective tissue. The remainder of the wall of the
stomach is composed of a large amount of connective tissue, an occasional
smooth muscle bundle, and an occasional islet 2 to 6 tumor cells. In the
tissue most remote from the pyloris there is no differentiation between the
mucosa and the serosa. The mucosa is replaced by tumor cells containing a
