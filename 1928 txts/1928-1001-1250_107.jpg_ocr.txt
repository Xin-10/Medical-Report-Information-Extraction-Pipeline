Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Interpretation: This papillary, tubular carcinoma has arisen in a breast which is also
the seat of a chronic cystic mastitis (Schimmelbusch's Disease). It is a rather benign
carcinoma, with most extensive necrosis and calcification. The axillary lymph glands,
which are extensively involved by the tumor, are abso anthracotic.
