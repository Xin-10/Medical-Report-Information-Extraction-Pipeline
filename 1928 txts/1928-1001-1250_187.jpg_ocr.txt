Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION Excision of Scar Tissue
Gross Dexcription: The specimen is of a piece of skin with scar tissue and underlying
fat and fascia. There is a slight induration at the center of the mass.
Microscopic: This is a section of skin. The lining stratified epithelium looks nor-
mal. The basement membrane is intact. Normal papillary projections are seen. The
corium is made up of rather loose connective tissue, which is practically acellular,
and shows slight necrosis in some places. With this is a thick layer of normal adi-
pose tissue. The blood vessels are normal in appearance. There is no cellular infil-
tration.
