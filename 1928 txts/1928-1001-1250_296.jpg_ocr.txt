Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION Complete Mastectomy, Left.
Gross Description: The specimen consists of the entire left breast with
the underlying pectoralis muscles. The whole specimen weighs 370 grams.
On the mesial side of the breast, about the left upper quadrant, is an ob-
lique incision of the previous operation. The wound looks healthy and is
closed with black silk. This leads down to a cavity which measures 5 cm.
in its longest diameter. This is filled with blood clots. Surrounding
this cavity is the slightly indurated breast tissue. This cuts easily.
The cut surface is smooth, shining and slightly yellowish in color. There
are three small lymph glands in the axillary region. The glands cut easily.
They are soft in consistency. The cut surface is yellowish in color.
Blocks: 1. From axillary gland.
2.
If breast tissue surrounding the cavity as a result of the
previous operation.
Microscopic: Section of a Gland. This is a section from the axillary
gland which is covered by normal adipose tissue. The gland shows
normal lymphoid structure and lymphfollicles. There are no mitotic

lymphoid masses is a stroma of rather loose connective tissue with normal
looking blood vessels and sinuses. There is no evidence of metastases.
Section 2 is a section from the indurated portion of the breast near the
site of the lesion. There are very few acini which are lined by one layer
of flat cells, although some of the acini show almost complete obliter-
ation of their lumena by masses of large, irregular and hyperchromatic
cells. No mitotic figures are seen. The stroma is made up of rather
dense hyalinized connective tissue. The blood vessels are dilated and
filled with red blood cells and from 4 to 12 polymorphs. There is defin-
ite infiltration of polymorphs.
