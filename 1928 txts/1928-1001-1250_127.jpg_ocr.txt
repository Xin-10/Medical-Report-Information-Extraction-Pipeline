Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing.
OPERATION
Radical Mastectomy with Removal of
Pectoral muscles and Axillary Glands.
Gross Description: The specimen consists of the left breast and measures 21 x 11.5
cm. and is about 6 cm. in thickness, weighing 1080 grams. A hard mass measuring 6.5
x 6.5 x 4 cm. is readily palpated through the skin, lying superiorly and medially
to the nipple. It is not attached to the skin and appears to be well separated from
the surrounding tissues. On the lateral superior border of the specimen is a chain
of hard, firm lymph nodes, which are about the size of a pea. A sagittal incision,
superior to the nipple, closed by catgut and 4 cm. long, is present. The under sur-
face presents normal appearing muscle tissue which on palpation fails to disclose any
hard or firm areas. The fat tissue is grossly normal. A deep cut through muscle and
fat into the firm tumor mass presents a cut surface, which is gristle like and flecked
with small, pin-head size spots. The tumor is a pinkish yellow and here and there,
there are small cavities, which ooze a necrotic material. On cutting, the knife
meets with a resistance comparable to that of cartilage, and the surface rapidly
invaginates. There is no macroscopic infiltration of the fat tissue around the mass,
nor is this surrounding tissue firm. The cut surface of the lymph gland is hard and
fibrotic throughout, the knife meeting the same resistance above described.
color the gland is a pearly white, with small red flecks on the surface.

Microscopic: Section 1 is a section of the breast through the tumor mass.
There is an evident decrease in the number of the acini, with a marked
increase in the supporting connective tissue. Many of the vesicles are
filled with large, epithelial like cells, hyperchromatic and necrotic.
Some of the acini are completely filled with these masses of epithelial
cells. The supporting stroma is so much increased that in many places
they have completely replaced the acini. In some places the practically
normal breast tissue is seen, with very few normal looking acini and fatty
tissue. The blood vessels are normal in appearance, and they are not
