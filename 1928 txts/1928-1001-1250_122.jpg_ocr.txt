Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION Biopsy of Cervical Erosions.
Gross Description: The specimen consists of a small fragment of Formalin fixed mucous
membrane and the underlying tissue. It measures 2 mm. x 1 mm., and is oval in shape.
It has a firm consistency.
Microscopic:
This is a section consisting of a mass of connective tissue incompletely
lined by stratified epithelium. Mucous glands are scattered all over the area. Many
of the glands are dilated and partially filled with cellular debris, round cells and
occasional polymorphs. The connective tissue is rather loose at the periphery, with
slight areas of necrosis. The blood vessle are slightly dilated with lymphocytic infil-
tration and occasional polymorphs. There is no sign of malignancy.
