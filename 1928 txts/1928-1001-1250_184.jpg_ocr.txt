Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION Excision of Carcinoma
Gross Description: The specimen measures 4 x 3 x 3 cm., and consists of a through and
through section of the cheek. On the mucous surface a deep, crater-like ulcer appears,
which measures 2.5 x 1.5 cm. in diameter and about .8 cm. in depth. The ulcer's edges
are punched out, burrowing down into several depressions which pierce deeper into the
soft tissue than the rest of the floor. The floor of the ulcer is made up of necrotic,
greenish tissue, which is easily fragmented. The mucous membrane about the central
part of the ulcer is undercut by erosion and is bluish gray in color. The tissue between
the mucous and epithelial surfaces is thickened and firm and is congested with blood.
The epithelial surface, save at the muco-cutaneous attachment at the lip, is free and
movable. The mucous membrane at the muco-cutaneous line shows a pearly grey over-
growth which slightly overlies the surrounding mucous membrane.
Blocks; 1. Muco-cutaneous junction with portion of floor of ulcer.
The
Microscopic: This is a section through the muco-cutaneous junction, show-
ing a portion of the floor of the lesion. It is made up of masses of
epithelial cells with thick layer of rather loose connective tissue.
masses of epithelial cells show marked keratinization. The cells are
closely packed together with very slight intervening connective tissue.
They show very slight amount of cytoplasm which is pink staining and gran-
ulab. The nuclei are irregular, deep staining, and many of them show kargo-
kinetic figures. There is pearl formation here and there. This does not
show any nucleus. In between the masses and columns of epithelial cells
are occasional dilated blood vessels with 3 to 5 polymorphs. and occasion-
al endothelial cells. The connective tissue underlying this is rather
loose and it shows slight necrosis.in some places. The blood vessels are
dilated and they show from 20 to 26 polymorphs and occasional lymphocytes.
There is no leucocytic infiltration. The part of the section through the
skin shows normal stratified epithelium with normal papillary projections.
The corium is made up of rather loose connective tissue with slightly
dilated blood vessels. The glands are normal in appearance.
