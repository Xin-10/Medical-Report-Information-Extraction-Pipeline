Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION Biopsy of tissue from cervix.
Gross description: The tissue consists of 3 fragments of Formalin-fixed mucosa,
measuring about .4 x .6 x .2 cm. respectively.
Microscopic: The microscopic sections of the tissue removed from the
cervix is composed of polipoid finger like processes of stroma com-
posed of connective tissue, with but very few fibers, and many cells
which are round, oval or stellate. Some of these finger like process-
es contain a blood vessel. In some areas the cells of the stroma are
widely separated by. vacuoles. These finger like processes are covered
by stratified squamous epithelium in some areas, by one layer of
columnar epithelium in others. The cervical mucous glands appear
normal. In some areas the squamous epithelium has grown down into the
deeper tissue but does not appear malignant.
