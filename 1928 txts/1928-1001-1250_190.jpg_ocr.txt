Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Excision of small pieces of
Soft Tissue from the Abdomin-
al Wound.
Gross Description: The specimen consists of several small pieces of
soft tissue from the abdominal wound.
Microscopic: The section shows a mass of rather dense connective tissue
partly lined by stratified epithelium. The lining epithelium looks
normal, with long papillary projections. The basement membrane is in-
tact. Underlying this is a mass of rather dense connective tissue which
is markedly hemorrhagic. The blood vessels are dilated and filled with
red blood cells and a few polymorphs. and lymphocytes. There is infil-
tration of lymphocytes around some of the vessels. Scattered in the
whole region are foreign body giant cells. No evidence of malignancy
could be made out.
