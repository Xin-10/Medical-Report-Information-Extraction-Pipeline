Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Microscopic: Section a is a section of a lymph gland which, in some areas, is composed
of normal lymphoid tissue, containing coal pigment, in other areas, and in by far the
majority of the gland, there are many tumor cells with a small amount of connective tissue
stroma. The tumor cells in most areas are arranged in papillary formation, and have a
large, light blue staining nucleus, which is granular and contains a well formed nucleo-
lus in a large amount of pink staining, granular cytoplasm. Ther is an occasional mitotic
figure. In most areas these islets of tumor cells are in tubular formation, lobulated
by connective tissue, which contains a rather large amount of coal pigment. Most of the
islets of tumor cells contain a large amount of necrotic tumor tissue in the center,
with the tumor cells around the periphery. In some areas the entire field is composed of
necrotic tumor cells.
Section b is another section of the lymph gland from a different region than section a.
At the periphery of the gland there are areas which contain a few normal staining tumor
cells. The remainder of the gland is composed of necrotic tumor tissue. There is also
coal pigment at the periphery of this gland, and in some areas it appears that the coal
pigment is in the tumor cells.

Section C is the primary tumor. The tumor cells are arranged in papillary and tubular
formation, and have the same morphology as those described in section a. There is a
large amount of necrosis in both the tumor cells and their connective tissue stroma.
There are a few mitotic figures seen.
Section d is another lymph gland, entirely replaced by the tumor, which, with the excep-
tion of its periphery, has undergone necrosis. Throughout this necrotic tissue are islets
of calcareus deposits.
Section e is from the tissue from the breast, surrounding the primary tumor. It is com-
posed of striated muscle and fat, and contains no tumor cells.
Section f is a section through breast tissue, and it contains no tumor cells. Throughout
the entire section are breast acini which are very small and surrounded by a large amount
of connective tissue stroma. In some areas the lymphatics are dilated and contain a large.
amount of protein preciptate with a few cells. There are many large cysts throughout the
section, lined by elongated epithelium, one to ten cells deep, and frilled in some areas
by a pink staining, granular precipitate.
Special stain: The anthrocotic lymph glands, stained with Mallory's Iron Stain, show
these glands to contain no iron.
Interpretation: This papillary, tubular carcinoma has arisen in a breast which is also the
seat of a chronic cystic mastitis (Schimmelbusch's Disease) It is a rather benign carci-
ith most extensive necrosis and calcification. The sxillary lymph
