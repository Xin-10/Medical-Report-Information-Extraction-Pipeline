Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Excision of Tumor
Gross Description: The specimen is of a tumor mass 3.8 x 2.1 x 1.2 cm.
The mass is pinkish white, firm and with a very hard indurated area at
one pole. The cut surface through the hard mass is pinkish and yellow,
and shows the small hard indurated area to be 0.5 cm. in diameter- the
edges of which are raised above the cut surface and the center retracted.
Blocks; 1. Through indurated portion

Microscopic: Section 1 is through the indurated portion of the breast.
E It is made up of dense collagen fibers with occasional acini and two ducts.
In the center of the area thereare masses of large, irregular and deep-
staining cells which are closely packed together. They line one of the
dilated ducts. The basement membrane is broken by the infiltration of
these hyperchromatic cells into the breast tissue. No mitotic figures
are seen. The masses of cells apparently fill and dilate the acini.
They show some finger projections which connect the various masses to-
gether. Surrounding this area of masses and columns of large hyperchro-
matic cells is fibrous tissue with occasional fibroblasts.
Section 2 is essentially similar to section 1. It is made up of a mass
of dense collagenous fibers with occasional normal looking acini and
ducts.
