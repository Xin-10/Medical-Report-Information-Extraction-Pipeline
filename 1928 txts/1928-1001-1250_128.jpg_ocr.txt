Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
dilated.
Section 2 is from the pectoralis muscle immediately underlying the tumor
mass. It is essentially normal. There is an area of hemorrhage in one place.
Section 3 is from the enlarged and hard sub-pectoral gland in the neighbor-
hood of the tumor. The normal lymphoid structure of the gland has been
almost completely replaced by marked fibrous tissue proliferations, with
seattered masses of large epithelial cells. These cells are irregular in
shape, with hyperchromatism and mitosis. The sinusoids are markedly dilated
and filled with masses of these cells. In some places the connective tissue
shows slight mucinous degeneration, while in others they are slightly
necrotic.
