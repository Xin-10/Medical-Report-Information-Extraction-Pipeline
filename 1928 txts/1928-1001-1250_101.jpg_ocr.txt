Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Gross Description: The specimen is of the anterior portion of both lobes
and isthmus of the thyroid gland. It weighs 42 grams. The lobes are 5 x
4 x 2 cm. each, and the isthmus 3 x 3 x 1 cm. The anterior surface is
roughly nodular, and the capsule over the anterior surface of the gland is
shining and intact. The nodules are separated by trabeculating connective
tissue. The largest nodules are about 2 cm. in diameter, and the smallest
about 0.5 cm. One large nodule in the left lobe exuded a clear amber
fluid on being cut. Several of the nodules are hemorrhagic. The gland
cuts easily but for 2 small gritty areas about 1 mm. in diameter.
gland is of uniform consistency, and sticky with a colloid material.
There are several small hemorrhagic areas on the cut surface.
Blocks: 1. Thru calcified plaque of left lobe.
2. Thru left lobe.
3. Right lobe.
4. Right lobe and large open cyst.
The
Microscopic: This is a section of a thyroid with colloid strechedand dilated
vesicles. The epithelial lining of the vesicles as a whole consists of
a single layer of low columnar epithelium, although in places there is
definite hyperplasia of the lining epithelium. There is slight increase
in the supporting stroma in places. Some of the blood vessels are slightly
dilated and are filled with red blood cells and an occasional round cell.
There is slight round cell infiltration. In places are inter-alveolar
collections of round cells.
