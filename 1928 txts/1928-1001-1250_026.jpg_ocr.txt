Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION - Right Salpingectomy and Partial
Bi-lateral Oophorectomy.
Gross Description: The right Fallopian tube is 12 cm. long by 3 mm. in
diameter at its uterine end, and 2 cm. at its distal end. The serosa is
smooth and glistening, but the distal 2/3 is heavily jected with blood.
Several small subserosal cysts are present on the fimbriated portion of the
tube. The distal half of the tube is patent, but the probe meets obstruc-
tion near the middle. The lumen of the proximal half is .5 mm. in diameter.
However it is patent. Upon opening, the mucosa of the distal half is thrown
into folds, yellow and glistening. The mucosa of the proximal half of the
tube is normal. The tissue from the right ovary consists of a mass of four
cysts filled with a clear amber fluid, of which the largest is 1.5 x 2 x
8 cm., and a corpus hemorrhagicum of approximately the same size. Very
little normal ovarian tissue is seen. The tissue from the left ovary shows
nore ovarian tissue, but the largest part of its bulk is made up of three
cystic masses of about .8 x .8 cm.
Microscopic: Section a is through the fimbriated end of the ovary, and
the muscularis and serosa are absent. The submucosa in some areas contains
a large amount of pink staining, granular precipitate, with a few fibro-
lasts throughout it. In some areas this pink staining, granular precipi-
cate with fibro-blasts extends down into the mucosa. The mucosa, otherwise,
appears normal.
Section b is also through the fimbriated end of the tube. The mucosa appears
ormal in most areas, but in some areas the fimbriated folds of the mucosa
djacent to the submucosa are obliterated by connective tissue, and the lumen
of the old crypts are filled with cellular debris, round cells and an
ccasional plasma cell. The muscularis appears normal, as does also the
erosa. Section c is a section of the right ovary, which contains a corpus
emorrhagicum almost completely developed into a corpus luteum. There are
lso several simple cysts and coppora albicantes. Section d is a cross
ection of the tube near the proximal end, and it appears normal.
