Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Excision of Lymph Gland
Gross Description: The specimen consists of two fragments of a lymph
gland, measuring 1 x 1 x 3 cm. It is grossly normal.
Microscopid: The section shows a mass of lymphoid tissue, with definite
hyperplasia of the lymphfollicles. Some of the blood vessels are dilated
and there is definite infiltration of plasma cells, occasional eosin-
philes and polymorphs. The sinuses are normal in appearance. Many of
them contain a mass of endothelial cells. In one region there is slight
amount of fibrosis with young connective tissue and some fibroblasts.
Two blood vessels in this region are dilated. They are filled with red
blood cells and endothelial cells and from 8 to 12 polymorphs.
SECOND OPERATION - Biopsy, Inguinal Gland.
of
Gross Description: The specimen consists a slightly enlarged gland which
is covered by a small amount of fatty tissue. It is soft in consistence
and covered by a thin, glistening membrane. It cuts easily and the cut
surface bulges out and is whitish in color. It is made up of a fine,
whitish, granular material, separated by a small amount of connective
tissue.
Microscopic: There is hyperplasia of the reticulum with occasional macro-
phages and plasma cells, which are found especially around slightly dilated
blood vessels. There is slight hyperplasia of the follicles. No evidence
of Hodgkin's Disease or lympho-sarcoma.
