Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing.
The specimen consists of half of the distal 6.5 cm. of the
tongue. It is 2.5 cm. wide and 2 cm. thick in its widest dimen-
sions. At a point 3 cm from the tip of the tongue on one side
there is a small ulcerated area which is depressed below the
surface of th mucous membrane. The ulcerated area is about .6cm
in diameter. There is very little induration about this area.
The section is thru the junction of the ulcerated area with the
normal mucosa. It shows normal mucous membrane which rather abruptly
shows a marked abnormal proliferation with downgrowths into the
underlying tissue. There are numerous keratohyaline pearls. The
base of the ulcerated area is composed of granulation tissue in which
are numerous accumulations of abnormal looking epithelial cells,
and showing marked leucocytic infiltration. Partially degenerated
striated muscle fibers are seen near the base of the ulcer. Normal
muscle is seen deeper in the section.
