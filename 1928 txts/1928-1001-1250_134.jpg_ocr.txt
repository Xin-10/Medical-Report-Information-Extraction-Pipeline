Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Radical Amputation of the Breast.
Gross Description: The specimen is of the right breast, and is eliptical, measuring
21 x 9 cm. The major tumor mass, palpable through the skin, measures 10 x 10 x 3 cm.,
and is not sharply limited but lies mostly under the nipple, superior and laterally.
The nipple appears to be normal and is not invaginated. The tumor mass is not attached
to the skin. On the lateral border several hard, firm, pea-sized lymph glands are pal-
pable, and in the tissue from the axilla a clump of glands are present. These latter
glands are not as firm as the former, but are hyperplastic. The fat tissue about the
tumor seems to be somewhat firmer than usual. On cut section the tumor mass is a pearly
white and yellow, the halves of the section falling away from the knife and bulging
outward. The knife does not meet with much resistance. In many places in the mass,
however, small areas, which are much firmer than the remainder, are present. On cut sec-
tion these cut with cartilagenous consistency, and appear quite fibrotic and pearly-
white. The lymph glands on cut section appear pearly white and yellow, and almost
mealy in consistency, although a deep lying gland from the lateral pectoral border is
quite hard and fibrotic and cuts hard.
Blocks: 1. Lymph gland from axilla.
2. Section from tumor mass.

fat tissue.
Microscopic: Section 1 is a section from an enlarged gland of the
axilla. The entire lymphoid structure has been almost completely
replaced by collections and masses of large, irregular shaped, epithelial
like cells. They are hyperchromatic, and many of them show mitotic
figures.
The sinuses are dilated with masses of the cells. There is a
region of lymphoid tissue where the sinusoids are dilated with masses
of epithelial cells, which show mitosis. In about the center of the
region is a large cavity of organizing red blood cells.
