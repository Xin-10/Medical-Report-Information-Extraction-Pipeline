Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Removal of Polyp from Left
Tonsil
Gross Description: The specimen is of a whitish, friable polyp about
0.7 cm. in diameter. It is quite firm to the touch.
Microscopic:
The section shows scattered masses of stratified epithelium.
They assume a variety of shapes; some are circular, others are thiangular,
while still others have a very irregular shape. In the center of these
masses are cavities where polipoid invagination of the epithelium into the
cavity is seen. The cells do not show hyperchromatism or mitosis. Many
of the cavities are extremely vascular, and the vessels are filled with
red blood cells and occasional polymorphs. In between the blood vessels
is a pinkish, granular substance. There is no sign of malignancy.
