Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION Right Partial Lobectomy
Gross Description: The specimen consists of almost 2/3 of the anterior portion of the

6.5 x 3 x 1.5 cm. One half of the thyroid is soft and is covered by a thin pinkish,
smooth capsule. There are small nodules deep under the capsule, which, on opening,

veals old, and probably fresh, haemorrhage, and diffuse, fleshy appearance of the
parenchyma. The other half is nothing but a mass of hard, calcified areas, which are
covered by the thin pinkish, glistening capsule of the thyroid. In one end of this

It is made up of vesicles which are dilated in most instances, although the rest are

there is slight increase in the stroma with areas of haemorrhage. The vesicles are lined
by one layer of low columnar cells. In some places there are small collections of
round cells between the vesicles. The blood vessels are dilated, filled with red blood
cells and in some regions there is definite haemorrhage. At the center of the area is
a small cyst with rupture of the wall, which is made up of a layer of flattened cells
with a slight amount of connective tissue.
