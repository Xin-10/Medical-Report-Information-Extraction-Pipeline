Gastric resection
Gross description: The specimen is 3/4 of the stomach and weighs 263.5
It measures 15 cms. from pylorus to the point of resection and
9 cms. from the mesentery of the greater curvature to that of the lesser.
The serosa is pink and glistening but the organ appears distended. A
large firm mass of pinkish yellow lymph glands, about 4 x 3 cm., is
present at the pylorus in the mesentery of the greater curvature, and a
single gland 1 x 1 cm. lies in the same mesentery about 6 cm. further
toward the cardia. The largest of the glands of the mass measures 2 x
1.5 x 1 cm. and in cut section appears made up of dense yellow tissue.
On cut section along the lesser curvature the stomach wall appears greatl
thickened. The pyloric ting appears normal and measures 6.5 cm. in cir-
cumference externally. The gastric end of the pylorus is greatly thicker
so that only the tip of the little finger may be introduced into the sto
mach. The thickening involves the sphincter itself. The tumor tissue
ends abruptly here. The induration is not present at the cardia but
appears at the pyloric sphincter and runs 12 cms. toward the cardia with
most involvment of the lesser curvature. At the points of greatest
thickening the mucosa is .8 cm. thick and the muscularis .5 cm. On cut
section the mucosa is a dense yellow tissue and contains many small col-
loid-appearing areas. The surface of the mucosa is a yellowish pink,
and is indented with enlarged gastric rugae. On the ventral surface,
about half way between the mesenteric attachments of the greater and
lesser curvatures, a large ulcerated area, with rounded margins and a
necrotic lining, measures 2.5 x 3.5 x .6 cm. Two other smaller areas of
about 1 x 1 cm. each appear further toward the cardia in the same position.
The blood vessels of the mesentery along the lesser curvature have a
white, granular tissue in the perivascular spaces.
Blocks: 1. Fundus through carcinoma
2. Pyloris through normal appearing area and carcinoma.
3. Normal gastric fundus near cardia
