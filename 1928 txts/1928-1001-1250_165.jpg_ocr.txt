Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Appendectomy
Gross Description: The specimen consists of an enlarged appendix. It
measures 8.5 cm. It is pinkish in color, with many scattered small hemorrrh-
agic spots in the sub-mucosa, especially along the incision of the meso-
appendix. It is soft and filled with fluid. The fluid is especially felt
about the middle of the distal third of the appendix, giving it a bulbous
appearance. The mouth of the appendix is closed, by a hard concretion,
which measures 6 mm. in its longest diameter. The content was aspirated.
under aseptic technic, and it was bloody, slightly thickened and mucoid
in character, about 5 cc. in amount. Culture was made from this content.
In one section the mucosa has found edematous, with many scattered hemorrh-
ages.lt. The point of impaction the mucosapis very much flattened. The
wall of the appendix at this point measures 3 mm., while in the middle
portion, about one inch from the impaction, the wall measures 5 mm. The
mucosa measures about 3 mm.
Blocks: 1. from middle portion of the appendix
2. near the caeco-appendicial opening just over the impaction.
first
Microscopic: The section is from the appendix. The lining mucous membrane
is partially denuded. The bub-epithelial layer is thickened. Edematous
blood vessels are dilated and are filled with red blood cells, polymorphs.,
and lymphocytes. The sub-mucosa is edematous. One region shows a partially
circumscribed area which is filled with polymorphs., cellular debris and
occasional lymphocytes. The blood vessels are dilated and are filled with
polymorphs. and red blood cells. There is definite infiltration of poly-
morphs in this layer. The muscularis is hormal in thickness. The blood
vessels are filled and infiltrated with polymorphs. and lymphocytes. The
serosa is thickened, the blood vessels dilated with marked infiltration of
polymorphs.
Section 2 is from the neck just over the impaction. The picture is essen-
tially the same as section 1, except that the whole lining mucosa in this
section is gone. The sub-mucosa and the muscularis are slightly thinned out.
There is marked infiltration of polymorphs. as in the first section.
