Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing.
OPERATION Excision of Cyst
‚òê Gross Description: The specimen consists of two fragments of connective tissue, one
measuring .2 x .2 x .1 cm., and the other .5 x .5 x .5 cm. The larger mass is soft and
cystic.
2 blocks entire specimen.
Microscopic: The section shows a cavity lined by squamous stratified epithelium which
appears normal. Underlying this is a corium which is made up of rather loose connective
tissue and patches of normal adipose tissue. There is slight haemorrhage in the corium
with scattered iron pigmentation. The blood vessels are slightly dilated and are filled
with red blood cells. The corium is normal in thickness, with hyalinized connective
tissue. There is slight necorsis in some places. The section through the cystic cavity
shows a lining which is made up of slight fibrous tissue and stratified epithelium,
with a corium which is made up of rather loose hyalinized tissue and normal adipose
tissue, with dilated blood vessels and scattered hemosiderin pigment.
