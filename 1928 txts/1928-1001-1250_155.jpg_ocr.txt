Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION Excision of Ulcer from Mouth
Gross Description: The specimen consists of a small mass of soft whitish
tissue. It measures about .5 cm. in diameter.
Microscopic: The section is nothing but a mass of necrotic tissue, which
is completely acellular. No blood vessels can be seen in the whole area.
It seems as if the whole area is made up of necrotic connective tissue.
There is no sign of malignancy.
