Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Rib-resection and drainage of
pus cavity.
Gross description: The specimen is of two Zenker fixed blocks of dense
white granulation tissue removed from the wall of the empyema cavity -
2 x 1 x 0.5 cm; and two pieces of rib bone 2.5 x 1 x 0.3 and 3.2 x 1 x 0.3
The rib sections are grossly normal. About 60 cc. of blood tinged
yellow pus was removed from the empyema cavity.
cm.
Microscopic: Section a is composed of skeletal muscle and rather dense connective
tissue. In some areas the connective tissue is heavily infiltrated by plasma cells,
a few round cells, histocytes and many polymorphs. In some areas there are masses of
polymorphs., cellular debris and fibrin, surrounded by granulation tissue. I see no
evidence. of tuberculosis.
Section b is similar to section a excepting that across one margin of the section is
the parietal pleura, which is greatly thickened by connective tissue, and which in
other areas is covered by pyogenic granulation tissue.
