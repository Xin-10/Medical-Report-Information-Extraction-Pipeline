Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Appendectomy and Unilateral Oophorec-
tomy.
Gross Description: The specimen is of one ovary and appendix. The ovary is 4 x 2.7 x
1 cm. in its largest dimensions. The serosa is pinkish, glistening and smooth. Protrud-
ing from the surface are about 12-15 small cysts, translucent and filled with a clear
amber fluid. The largest is about 0.6 cm. in diameter, and protrudes about 1.5 mm. The
smallest is about 1 mm. in diameter. The ovary is soft and fluctuating. The parenchyma
is pinkish, cystic and at one pole is a corpus haemorrhagicum, 1 cm. in diameter, and
at a pole diametrically opposite is a corpus luteum, 0.9 cm. in diameter.
The opened appendix measures 5.5 x 1.3. The serosa is pinkish. The muscularis is
firm, pinkish and is .04 cm. thick. The mucosa is pinkish, slightly edematous and measures
.1 cm. thick. The rugae are normal. The attached mesenteriolumis 5.5 x 0.7 cm. and
is yellow.
Blocks: 1. Through corpus haemorrhagicum

Section 1 shows a fairly dense stroma of fibrous tissue, with many spindle
shaped cells and normal appearing blood vessels, which are filled with red blood cells
and very occasional polymorphs. and lymphocytes. In one region there is a cavity which is
filled with organizing red blood cells and some iron pigment.
Section 2 is similar to section 1. In addition there is a corpus luteum in one region
and several follicle cysts.
Section 3 shows a section through the wall of one of the cysts. It is made of old,
rather loose connective tissue, with slightly dilated blood vessels. Some of the blood
vessels contain from 2 to 4 polymorphs. and about the same number of lymphocytes. It
is lined by low cuboidal cells and shows many spindle shaped cells and some cells loaded
with iron iron pigment.
The
Section 4 is through the appendix. The lining epithelium is missing in some places.
sub-epithelial layer is normal in appearance. The blood vessels are slightly dilated.
The submucosa is normall in thickness. The blood vessels are dilated with infiltration
of small lymphocytes and occasional plasma cells. The muscularis is normal in thickness.
So is the serosa.
