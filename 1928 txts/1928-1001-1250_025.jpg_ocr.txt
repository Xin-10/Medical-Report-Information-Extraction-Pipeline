Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Excision and Fulguration of
Ulcerated Tract.
Gross description: The tissue consists of a fragment of heavily
injected mucosa and subcutaneous tissue measuring 2 x .4 cm.
Microscopic: The microscopic sections of the rectal ulcer are composed
of both young and old connective tissue, heavily infiltrated by plasma
cells and round cells, with a large number of polymorphs in some areas.
In other areas, in old connective tissue, there are masses of inflammatory
cells arranged in columns, as though they were fistulous tracts. The
wall of the ulcer is composed of old connective tissue, which has lost
its cellular detail, and extravasated blood. Underlying this tissue is
a pink staining, granular and thread like precipitate of cellular debris,
heavily infiltrated by polymorphs.
