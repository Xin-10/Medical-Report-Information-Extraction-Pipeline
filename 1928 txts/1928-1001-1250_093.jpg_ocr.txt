Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Cholecystectomy
Gross description: The formalin injected gall bladder measures 11.5 x 3.5
cm., and weighs 79 grams. The serosa is smooth and glistening, and the wall
is distended here and there by hard masses which are distinctly palpable.
A few easily broken fibrous adhesions spring from the anterior surface of
the serosa, which is rather heavily injected by blood. . At the mouth of the
gall bladder, just lateral to the cystic duct, a 1 x 1 cm. diverticulum is
noted. On the superior surface and sub-serosally, two small, rather firm
lymph glands are noted, which are also in close proximity to the cystic
duct. Bile can be expressed from the cystic duct. On cut section the wall
of the gall bladder is 1.5 mm. thick, the rugae are absent from the mucosa
and the surface is white and trabeculated. The contents of the gall bladder
are made up of a greenish mucus-like fluid and many faceted cholesterol
stones, the largest being 3 x 3 x 2 cm. (Three of the sides of the largest
stone are faceted and the fourth follows the contour of the wall of the
gall bladder.) The wall of the gall bladder at the ampulla is 3 mm. thick.
Microscopic: The microscopic section shows the gall bladder with the lin-
ing epithelium broken in places. The epithelium in places is thrown into
reticulating folds. The sub-epithelial layer is slightly thickened. The
blood vessels are slightly dilated, and filled with red blood cells. There
is very slight infiltration of round cells and occasional plasma cells are
seen. The muscularis is normal in thickness. The blood vessels are dilated,
with occasional polymorphs. in some of them. In the perimascular layer the
blood vessels are slightly dilated with a few polymorphs., and round cell
infiltration. The serosa is normal in thickness and in appearance. Roki-
tansky Aschoff bodies are found in the muscularis.
