Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing.
filled with a soft gray tissue. Below this, in the most superficial part of the
snout, is an area of cancellous bone, surrounding a small area of dense white bone,
containing a cavity 2 x 1 mm., filled with cartilage.
x 1 mm., filled with cartilage. Extending down from the snout
are four teeth, one of which has a long root and is covered by enamel. he skin
extending from the snout has the appearance of an upper lip. There is a definite
internal and external table to the skull, separated, however, by cancellous bone.
Microscopic: Section
Section 1 is from the wall of the cyst. It shows a rather thick layer
of fibrous connective tissue, with absence of the epithelial lining. The blood
vessels appear normal. There is no leucocytic infiltration.
Section 2 shows the content of the cystic cavity. At a portion where it is
attached to the lining membrane the section shows a picture of the skin. This is
lined by stratified epithelium with occasional normal appearing papillary folds. The
corium is made up of rather loose fibrous connective tissue with many sweat and
sebaceous glands. Underlying this is a rather thick layer of normal adipose tissue,
with a small strip of osseous tissue with normal lacunae and bone cells. Two
teeth are found at this region. The rest of the section shows the interlacing
network of spongy bone, with living bone cells. The intervening marrow is made up
of rather loose fibrous connective tissue, red blood cells, monocytes and osteo-
blasts. Many of the latter are lined by spongeous trabeculae, with evidence of
slight bone formation. There is a small area which is filled with cartilage. There
is a rather large space which corresponds to the skull in the gross specimen is
seen at one end of the section. It is surrounded by a rather thick layer of normal
living bone. The cavity is found empty. No evidence of brain tissue can be seen.
Lining one portion of the cavity is a thin layer of fibrous tissue with occasional
blood vessels which are partially filled with degenerated red blood cells. This
membrane, which corresponds to the dura as seen in the gross specimen, is continuous
down to a small canal. This canal does not show any evidence of a spinal cord.
Attached to a small portion of the section is a piece of thyroid tissue.
