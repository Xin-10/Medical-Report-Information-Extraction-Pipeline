Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Biopsy
Gross Description: The specimen is of a small piece of yellow tissue, 3 x 2 x 1 mm.,
with roughened surface. The tissue is friable.
Microscopic: This shows a mass of rather loose connective tissue, with
masses of epithelial like cells, dilated blood vessels, and occasional
muscle tissue. There is hyperchromatism in the cells, but no mitotic
figures could be seen. There are a fair number of epithelial pearls.
In several places there are collections of polymorphs and lymphocytes.
In an area, which is practically necrotic, the blood vessels are dilated
with lymphocytic infiltration and polymorphs. There is slight keratini-
zation seen.
