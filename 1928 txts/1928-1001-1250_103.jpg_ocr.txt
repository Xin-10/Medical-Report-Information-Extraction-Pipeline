Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing.OPERATION
Hysterectomy.
Gross description: The specimen is of uterus and attached vaginal wall with its tumor
masses, left tube and ovary, and weighs 1570 grams. It measures 19 x 16 x 14 cm. The
serosa of the uterus is roughly nodular, but smooth and glistening. Protruding from
upper and lateral surfaces are numerous fibroid masses, about 4 cm. in diameter, each
divisable into small fibroid masses. These masses protrude more from the left side than
the right. They are sub-serous. The under surface is roughemed and hemorrhagic at its
place of detachment. The ovary measures 5 x 4.5 x 3 cm.
The ovary measures 5 x 4.5 x 3 cm., and is completely covered.

The cervix is dilated and flaccid. The vaginal wall attached is normal. The ovary is
completely covered by serosa which is pinkish and glistening, except in areas where sev-
eral hemorrhagic nodules, about .7 cm. in diameter, protrude about 1 mm. above te surface.
The ovary is soft except at its center where a hard nodule is palpated. The serous
surface of the tube is pinkish and glistening, except at the fimbriated end which is
hemorrhagic. The tube measures 14 cm. long, and has a diameter of about 0.4 cm.
The opened uterus is seen to have its muscularis thickened to 2.5 cm.
laris is pinkish and firm. The mucosa is pinkish and covered by a cloudy mucus.
cut surface of the tumor is whitish, firm and is of dense white, nodular tissue.
strands run in all directions. The mass is 8 cm. thick, and protrudes from just below
the serosa. There are no submucous intramural tumors. The parenchyma of the ovary is
soft, yellowish and hemorrhagic. In the center is a well encapsulated hemorrhagic cyst,
in the crater of which is a blood clot surrounded by a cloudy amber fluid. The tube is
patent throughout, is 1 mm. thick, and the mucosal surface is pinkish.
Anatomical diagnosis: Fibro-myoma of uterus.
Blocks: 1. Thru parenchyma of ovary, including corpus luteum.
