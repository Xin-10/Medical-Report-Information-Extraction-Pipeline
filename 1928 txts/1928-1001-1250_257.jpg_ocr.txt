Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing.
The gross specimen consists of the breast which has been preserved
in fixing solution. It is cut across in two places. The cut surface
showed in one place what appeared to be the wall or a small abscess
cavity. Section taken through this region.
The microscopic section shows a diffuse lymphocytic infiltration
throughout the breast tissue. In several places there are areas of
caseation necrosis bordered by granulation tissue made up of lympho-
cytes, endothelial cell accumulations and in some places giant cells.
