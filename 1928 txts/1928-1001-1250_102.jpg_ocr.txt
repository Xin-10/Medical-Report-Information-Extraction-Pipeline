Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing.
OPERATION
00phorectomy, Salpingectomy, Appen-
dectomy and amputation of cervix uteri.
Gross description: The specimen consists of a normal appendix and an entire ovary. The
ovary contains a corpus haemorrhagicum cyst, a corpus luteum involuting cyst and a pap-
illomatous white area .5 cm. in diameter. The amputated cervix uteri has a small ero-
sion encircling the os.
The uterine curretted material consists of fragments of endo-
metrium, mucus and blood. The Fallopian tube is normal.
Blocks: 1. Appendix
2,3,4. Through ovary.
5. Uterine curretted material.
6. Cervix
7. Tube
Microscopic:
Section a is a section from the appendix. The lining mucous membrane is
almost completely denuded. The submucosa is normal in thickness. Some of the blood
The
vessels are slightly dilated. Occasional plasma cells and eosinophiles are seen.
muscularis is normal in thickness. The serosa is intact. There is an occasional dilated
blood vessel with one to two polymorphs. in them.
Section b is an area of dense connective tissue with a large amount of cellular material.
The cells are mostly spindle shaped. In the whole area there is one well dilated gland
surrounded by connective tissue. In places the connective tissue appears to undergo
necrosis. The connective tissue has various arrangements. Here and there blood vessels
are present. They are in most instances slightly dilated and filled with red blood
cells. There is no leucocytic infiltration.
Section c
In
shows an area of dense connective tissue which is markedly cellular.
places the connective tissue is necrotic, with a marked decrease of cellular elements.
There is a good number of iron pigmented cells, especially at the periphery. The blood
vessels are slightly dilated with red blood cells, a few polymorphs. and lymphocytes.
One of the vessels has 8 or 10 polymorphs. in its lumen. There is a slight round cell
infiltration.
