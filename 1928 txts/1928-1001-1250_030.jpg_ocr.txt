OPERATION
Removal of Cyst.
Gross Description: The specimen is of a formalin fixed cyst of the ovary
(diagnosis by X-Ray), which weighs 236 grams and measures 9 x 7 x6.5 cm.
The mass is glistening and smooth, except at its posterior portion where
it was detached. At a point diametrically opposite from the detached
pedicle is a yellowish triangular area, 3 cm. at the base and 2 cm. at the
sides, with many small cysts, the largest of which is 1 x 0.7 cm., and the
smallest about 0.5 mm. Below this is a large yellowish cystic area, 3 x
2 cm., which protrudes from the surface about 2 mm. The capsule varies in
color - bluish, yellowish, pinkish and whitish.
The formalin fixed specimen, which was halved longitudinally, was
filled with a yellow sebaceous material of soft, lard-like consistency.
The cyst wall is about 0.5 mm. thick. The inner surface sorresponds to
the description of the outer, only it is not glistening. In the center of
the yellowish material is a spherical mass about 4.5 cm. in diameter.
This is covered by pinkish, porous skin, and projecting from one pole is
a tuft of soft brown hairs about 3 cm. long. At the other pole of the
sphere a smaller box-shaped mass extends out for about 1 cm., which is
covered by skin continuous with that covering the mass. Short lunuga like
hairs cover the entire surface. The central mass, under the skin, was halved
by a saw, and cut with difficulty. The skin on the halved specimen is 3mm.
thick. At the skin underlying the tuft of hairs are striations correspond-
ing to the striations of the sebaceous glands found in the scalp. Under-
lying the skin is white pericranium. The skin, covers a skull and overlying
the skull is a periosteum. Thereis a vault inthe skull about 2 x 1.5 cm.,
which is lined by a tissue that resembles the dura. On reflection of the
lura there is seen striations on the skull corresponding to the arteries.
Extending from this cavity is a canal which corresponds to the spinal canal.
This canal is covered by dura, which is continuous with that of the large
cavity. At the lower portion of the canal the dura is adherent to the
overlying skin. One side of the skull has the shape of a snout, the super-
lor surface of the snout containing a small cavity 3 x 4 mm., which is
