Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Right Mastoidectomy
Gross Description: The specimen consists of several fragments of thin
cortical bone and underlying spongy bone, with a little granulation
tissue
Microscopic:
The section shows pieces of bone with intervening marrow.
Many of these trabeculae show presence of living bone cells, although in
others the bone cells are absent, with evidence of absorption by the
surrounding fibrous tissue. The marrow cavity is filled with degener-
ated red blood cells, marked fibrous connective tissue, monocytes and
polymorphs. The blood vessels are normal in appearance.
