Gross and Microscopic Description and Drawing. OPERATION
Microscopic: Section 1 shows a mass of dense connective tissue, which is
in various arrangements. The cells are mostly spindle shaped. There is
no hyperchromatism or mitosis. In the center of the region is a cellular
area filled with degenerated red blood cells. In this area the columnar
arrangement of the luteal cells can still be discerned. This is enclosed
by connective tissue capsules. The blood vessels are slightly dilated
immediately surrounding this cavity. The blood vessels are filled with
red blood cells and a few polymorphs.
Section 2 is a section from the wall of the uterus. It is made up of
muscle and connective tissue, with a number of slightly dilated blood
vessels. The wall is slightly thickened. In one place there is a mass
of connective tissue, with spindle shaped cells. This, however, does not
show hyperchromatism or mitosis. In some places there is slight necrosis
seen in the connective tissue.
Sections 3 and 4 show a huge mass of connective tissue, with slight
mucinous degeneration in the center. The cells are normal in appearance.
They are not hyperchromatic and do not show any mitosis. The blood vessels
are dilated. There is no leucocytic infiltration.
