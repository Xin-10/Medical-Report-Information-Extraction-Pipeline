Gross Description: The specimen is of a hernial sac of peritoneum.
are two pieces of peritoneum - (1) triangular in shape, measuring 6 x 5.5
x 5.5 cm, and (2) one of trapezoid shape, measuring 2 x 7.5 x 8 cm.
The peritoneal surface is glistening, white and shows a puckered out pouch-
ing about 0.4 cn. from the level of the peritoneum proper.
The pre-
peritoneal surface is pinkish and has attached to it tags of yellow fat.
Microscopic: The section shows an area of adipose tissue with scattered
layers of rather dense connective tissue. The blood vessels are dilated.
Many of them are filled with red blood cells, a few polymorphs. and lym-
phocytes. One of the vessels shows organizing degenerated blood cells,
with definite infiltration of small lymphocytes, plasma cells, a few poly-
morphs and a slight iron pigment. There is definite infiltration of lym-
phocytes in many of the blood vessels.
