OPERATION Microscopic: Section a is taken from the mesentery of the lesser curvature of the stomach. It contains normal adipose tissue, with areas of connective tissue which occupy an entire low power field. These areas of connective tissue contain lymphatic vessels which are greatly enlarged and fibrosed by rather young connective tissue. The lumen of some of these vessels contain a pink staining, granular precipitate. In other areas the pervascular lymphatics are plugged by tumor thrombi. These tumor cells contain a round pychotic, granular nucleus, with a rather large amount of pink staining cytoplasm. No mitotic figures are seen. Several of the small veins contain ante-mortem thrombi%3 others large numbers of polymorphs. Section b is a section of a lymph gland at the pyloris on the greater curvature. Many of the lymphfollicles are hyperplastic. Around the entire margin of the gland the sinuses are engorged by cells which have a round, granular, pycnotic nucleus, and a rather large amount of pink staining cytoplasm. No mitotic figures are seen. Throughout the entire gland there is an occasional sinusoid that is engorged by these tumor cells. Some of them extend down from the peripheral sinusoid. Throughout the capsule of the gland there are many small lympnatics plugged by tumor cells and islets of 2 to 15 tumor cells throughout the connective tissue. Section C is a section through the pyloris, and a margin of the tumor. The mucosa of the pyloris and the pyloric glands is normal. The muscularis is greatly hypertrophied. The serosa is greatly thickened by connective tissue which contains an occasional islet of 2 to 6 tumor cells. The mucosa of the pyloris ends abruptly and a tumor area begins. The mucosa of the tumor area contains only an occasional crypt. The majority of it is smooth,+ covered by epithelium of cuboidal type, one cell deep. This epithelium is the same type of epithelium as is seen in the crypts where present. Just beneath this epithelium is an occasional remnant of the gastric crypts and a large amount of connective tissue. The fundic glands of the submucosa are infiltrated by connective tissue. The remainder of the wall of the stomach is composed of a large amount of connective tissue, an occasional smooth muscle bundle, and an occasional islet 2 to 6 tumor cells.

In microscopic sections of the uterine curretted material, there are many areas in which the syncitial cells of Hanson make up the majority of the tissue with extravasated blood. In some areas there are merely one or two syncitial cells in a stroma composed of Langhans' cells. There is also a large amount of fibrin and extravasated blood throughout the entire section. At one margin of the section the tissue had lost all morphological detail, is necrotic, and in some areas along this margin this necrotic tissue is heavily infiltrated by polymorphs. Section b is composed of a mass of red blood cells and fibrin. Section d is composed of strips of light pink staining, homogeneous material, which repre- sents a cross section of the membrane described above. Section c is composed of many villi of connective tissue covered by epithelium. The spaces in between these villi are filled with acellular, pink to light blue staining, gran- ular protein precipitate. There are also villi here and there which contain giant cellsy at their margins. The tissue composed of these villi is surrounded by very cellular connec tive tissue.

At the mouth of the gall bladder, just lateral to the cystic duct, a 1 x 1 cm. diverticulum is noted. On the superior surface and sub-serosally, two small, rather firm lymph glands are noted, which are also in close proximity to the cystic duct. Bile can be expressed from the cystic duct. On cut section the wall of the gall bladder is 1.5 mm. thick, the rugae are absent from the mucosa and the surface is white and trabeculated. The contents of the gall bladder are made up of a greenish mucus-like fluid and many faceted cholesterol stones, the largest being 3 x 3 x 2 cm. (Three of the sides of the largest stone are faceted and the fourth follows the contour of the wall of the gall bladder.) The wall of the gall bladder at the ampulla is 3 mm. thick. Microscopic: The microscopic section shows the gall bladder with the lin- ing epithelium broken in places. The epithelium in places is thrown into reticulating folds. The sub-epithelial layer is slightly thickened. The blood vessels are slightly dilated, and filled with red blood cells. There is very slight infiltration of round cells and occasional plasma cells are seen. The muscularis is normal in thickness. The blood vessels are dilated, with occasional polymorphs. in some of them. In the perimascular layer the blood vessels are slightly dilated with a few polymorphs., and round cell infiltration. The serosa is normal in thickness and in appearance. Roki- tansky Aschoff bodies are found in the muscularis.",1928-1001-1250_093.jpg_ocr.txt,parsed

At the lateral, superior border of the specimen is another mass composed of hard enlarged lymph glands about 2 x 2 cm. The nipple is not retracted. On cut section the breast mass is seen to be composed of a firm pinkish white, glistening tissue which is flecked with innumerable small yellow granules. Extending from the mass through the breast fat are streaks of dense white tissue. The mass of glands at the lateral superior border on cut section are seen to have a hard cartilaginous capsule and the lymphoid tissue is completely obliterated by caseous, necrotic material.

Most of the islets of tumor cells contain a large amount of necrotic tumor tissue in the center, with the tumor cells around the periphery. In some areas the entire field is composed of necrotic tumor cells. Section b is another section of the lymph gland from a different region than section a. At the periphery of the gland there are areas which contain a few normal staining tumor cells. The remainder of the gland is composed of necrotic tumor tissue. There is also coal pigment at the periphery of this gland, and in some areas it appears that the coal pigment is in the tumor cells. อ Section C is the primary tumor. The tumor cells are arranged in papillary and tubular formation, and have the same morphology as those described in section a. There is a large amount of necrosis in both the tumor cells and their connective tissue stroma. There are a few mitotic figures seen. Section d is another lymph gland, entirely replaced by the tumor, which, with the excep- tion of its periphery, has undergone necrosis. Throughout this necrotic tissue are islets of calcareus deposits. Section e is from the tissue from the breast, surrounding the primary tumor. It is com- posed of striated muscle and fat, and contains no tumor cells. Section f is a section through breast tissue, and it contains no tumor cells. Throughout the entire section are breast acini which are very small and surrounded by a large amount of connective tissue stroma. In some areas the lymphatics are dilated and contain a large. amount of protein preciptate with a few cells. There are many large cysts throughout the section, lined by elongated epithelium, one to ten cells deep, and frilled in some areas by a pink staining, granular precipitate. Special stain: The anthrocotic lymph glands, stained with Mallory's Iron Stain, show these glands to contain no iron.

On the lateral border several hard, firm, pea-sized lymph glands are pal- pable, and in the tissue from the axilla a clump of glands are present. These latter glands are not as firm as the former, but are hyperplastic. The fat tissue about the tumor seems to be somewhat firmer than usual. On cut section the tumor mass is a pearly white and yellow, the halves of the section falling away from the knife and bulging outward. The knife does not meet with much resistance. In many places in the mass, however, small areas, which are much firmer than the remainder, are present. On cut sec- tion these cut with cartilagenous consistency, and appear quite fibrotic and pearly- white. The lymph glands on cut section appear pearly white and yellow, and almost mealy in consistency, although a deep lying gland from the lateral pectoral border is quite hard and fibrotic and cuts hard. Blocks: 1. Lymph gland from axilla. 2. Section from tumor mass. 3. "" fat tissue. Microscopic: Section 1 is a section from an enlarged gland of the axilla. The entire lymphoid structure has been almost completely replaced by collections and masses of large, irregular shaped, epithelial like cells. They are hyperchromatic, and many of them show mitotic figures. The sinuses are dilated with masses of the cells. There is a region of lymphoid tissue where the sinusoids are dilated with masses of epithelial cells, which show mitosis. In about the center of the region is a large cavity of organizing red blood cells.",1928-1001-1250_134.jpg_ocr.txt,parsed

OPERATION Section 2 is a section of normal breast tissue with a portion of the tumor growth. The acini are small; many of them show hyperplasia of the lining epithelium, with papillary arrangement. In some of the acini this papillary arrangement of the hyperplastic lining has so encrouched upon the lumen that it almost obliterates the cavity. The cells are hyperchromatic and show occasional mitotic figures. The basement membrane in many places shows extension downward into the supporting stroma of hyperchromatic cells from the lining epithelium. The connective tissue. stroma shows slight increase. In some regions there is definite necrosis. The blood vessels are slightly dilated and filled with occasional red blood cells and occasional polymorphs. The ducts appear normal, excepting for a slight dilatation. Section 3 is a section of the fatty tissue immediately surrounding the tumor mass. This shows normal fatty tissue. G.

Block; section from middle. and The formalin fixed gall bladder measures 7.5 x 4 x 2.3 cm., weighs 35 grams, contained 12 cc. of a brownish-green, thick fluid. The sac is not collapsed. In the central portion of the gall bladder, three hard masses may be palpated in the positions indicated in the drawing. Several areas of sub-serosal hemorrhage are present. On cut section the serosa is of normal thickness, while the mucosa is 1.5 mm. in thickness. The wall in toto is 4 mm. in thickness. At the distal end of the gall bladder invagin- ation of the wall has produced a second pouch, which is lined by normal smooth mucosa. This pouch measures 1.5 cm. in diameter. This secondary cavity is in direct continuity with the first. The major cavity is lined by granular roughened mucosa, which is flattened to accomodate the stone. One large stone, measuring 3 x 2 x 1 cm., is present. The weight is 5 grams, and the stone is of the cholesterol-pigment-calcium variety. It is studded by nodules of apparently calcium concretions. The color is a mixture of yellow, green, and white. Blocks: 1. from neck of gall bladder 2. body of"" 11 Microscopic: This is a section from the appendix.

This is a purplish red in color and is deeply pitted at one surface. At the base of the area is an ex- tremely hard, cartilaginous gland which is necrotic on cut section, the contents being yellow and thick in consistency. The largest of the mass of glands is 1.5 cm. The glands are pink and soft. On cut section the glands are pearly white and are not necrotic. The glands represent the right submaxillary lymph glands. The submental mass measures 3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm., and is made up of connective tissue, fat and one gland, 1 x .5 cm. The gland is soft and appears to be normal. One surface of the mass is pink and glistening and the other is yellowish pink and is studded by fat nodules.","Microscopic: Section 1 is a section through the maxillary gland. The capsule of the gland is made up of connective tissue and slightly dilated blood vessels, with occasional areas of normal looking adipose tissue. The gland proper shows an almost complete replacement of the lymphoid structure by masses and columns of highly keratinized epithelial cells. They assume the structure of stratified epithelium, with pearl formation. The cells are large, and irregular in shape, with very little cytoplasm. The nuclei are hyperchromatic, and many of them show mitosis. In the center of some of these masses of epithelial cells are areas of slight necrosis and mucoid degeneration. The sinuses of the gland are dilated and filled with masses of these epithelial cells. In one region is a small area of lymphoid tissue, with lymphoid follicles present. In between the masses of epithelial cells are areas of connective tissue with an abundance of young fibroblasts.

The floor of the ulcer is made up of necrotic, greenish tissue, which is easily fragmented. The mucous membrane about the central part of the ulcer is undercut by erosion and is bluish gray in color. The tissue between the mucous and epithelial surfaces is thickened and firm and is congested with blood. The epithelial surface, save at the muco-cutaneous attachment at the lip, is free and movable. The mucous membrane at the muco-cutaneous line shows a pearly grey over- growth which slightly overlies the surrounding mucous membrane.","Microscopic: This is a section through the muco-cutaneous junction, showing a portion of the floor of the lesion.

The nuclei are irregular, deep staining, and many of them show kargokinetic figures. There is pearl formation here and there. This does not show any nucleus. In between the masses and columns of epithelial cells are occasional dilated blood vessels with 3 to 5 polymorphs. and occasional endothelial cells.

ABSTRACT OF HISTORY OF ELIAS SHUTAN, AGE 65, ADDRESS: 5341 HYDE PARK BLVD. PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL NO. 207,486. Diagnosis: Cholecystitis and cholelithiasis. Death from angina pectoris following operation. For 35 years patient has had bilious attacks. For seven years he has had attacks of pain in the epigastrium which were sharp at times. They were brought on by eating a heavy meal. Enema relieved the fla- tus and often relieved the attacks. Pain usually reaches its height in 5 minutes. The pains refer to the chest and sometimes out into the arms. Six weeks ago he had a severe attack from which he collapsed. It lasted 4 hours. He has been confined to bed since then. He sometimes has three attacks in the week, and again none for a month. He has had attacks of angina pectoris that have been severe, abdominal pain and gas distension. Not infrequently comes on after a heavy meal. Physical examination was negative aside from slight tenderness in the region of the gall bladder. The heart was slightly enlarged but regular and there were no adventitious sounds. Blood pressure 116/72. Pulse, temperature, respiration normal. Diagnosis; Cholelithiasis, but x-rays taken before admission showed 2 sha- dow of gall stones. The gall bladder was removed 12-30-26. A stone was found in the cystic duct which was milked out with great difficulty. The gall bladder was filled with a large stone and also some fluid which had a green yellow color. Three days later the patient had an anginal attack from which he died. No autopsy was obtained. GROSS EXAMINATION: The gall bladder is 11 by 6mcm. when opened and is roughly triangular. The mucosa lies in folds, and is very much injected with blood, especially in the region of the fundus.",1928-1001-1250_215.jpg_ocr.txt,parsed

In the region of the neck it is pink-grey. The wall of the bladder is somewhat thickened. The concretion whose shape fits the cavity of the gall bladder is green-brown, soft and sticky. It is 6.5 cm. long, 2.5 cm. in diameter and roughly sausage shaped. It resembles a fecolith very much. In the larger end of the concretion there is a small half-moon shaped area not covered by soft material; thisarea is smooth, black and hard. MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION: In sections of the gall bladder, the mucous layer is irregular and missing in some areas and where present is thin. The fibro-muscular layer consists largely of muscle tissue. There is a slight round cell infiltration of the muscle tissue and the capil- laries are engorged. Adipose tissue is present. The serosa is slightly thickened. 13",1928-1001-1250_216.jpg_ocr.txt,parsed
